Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.
