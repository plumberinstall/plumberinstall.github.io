<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a waste disposal unit is only geared up to manage softer natural waste. If bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal, it could trigger it to jam and not work appropriately. By running warm water through the disposal, you might be able to clear the clog yourself. However you risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
<p>Often triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then inspect and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Alternatively, often a faulty fill valve might activate periodically, too. Water won't drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>There are health and safety threats one must prevent while dealing with a sewer line task. Methane gas, salmonella, e. coli, giardia - all are found in sewer pipes and may expose employees during the sewer repair procedure.

Another danger in sewer repair jobs is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig website. Your security and health are too important to run the risk of in a DIY sewer job! Prevent these security threats by working with a professional plumber.</p>
