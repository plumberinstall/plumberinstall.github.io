<p>No, you ought to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about securing your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be far more destructive than useful, possibly gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's entire plumbing system, including both water system and drain lines. Generally, a whole-house repipe is worth the investment in the long run since it might deal with the root reason for the persistent plumbing problems in your house.</p>
<p>Galvanized metal, is just an easier method of saying zinc coated" and what triggers galvanized pipes to corrode is the exposure to excessive water and minerals. You may be thinking that it does not make good sense to use a pipe that reacts with water as your house's main source of water transportation, and you would be correct. However, when most of these pipes were being set up, no one understood this was going to be the result. Thankfully, there are a great deal of other piping choices nowadays including copper.</p>
<p>Pieces that comprise kitchen sink drains can end up being corroded and worn, resulting in leakages. Depending upon the severity of the circumstance, just one piece may need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly needs to be gotten rid of and changed. Components involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Incorrectly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
