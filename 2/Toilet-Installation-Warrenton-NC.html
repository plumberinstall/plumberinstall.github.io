<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
