<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification.

<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Walker LA</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>
