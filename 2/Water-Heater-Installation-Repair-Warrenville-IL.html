<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
