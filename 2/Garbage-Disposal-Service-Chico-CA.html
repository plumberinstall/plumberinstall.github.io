<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
