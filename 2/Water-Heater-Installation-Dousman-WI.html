Before installing, your professional will shut off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new installing ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is attached to its mount. In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
