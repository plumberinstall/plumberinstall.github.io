<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it comes to pipe repair, the most expensive factors aren't the equipment or materials utilized, but the landscaping, yard and uprooting damage that ensues.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.
