<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Many softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to offer some sort of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to maintain the unit.</p>
