<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak.

If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also inspect to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
