<p>Letters are sent out to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and jacuzzis.

Depending upon the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>The level 3 of maintenance your disposal system will need can differ depending on how typically it's utilized, its age, and the kind of products you're putting in it.
