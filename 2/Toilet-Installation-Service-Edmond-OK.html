<h3>Qualities Of Good Emergency Plumbers Edmond OK</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had great reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
<p>Prior to we deem the job complete, we carry out a follow-up camera inspection to guarantee the drain and sewer cleaning was 100% efficient. If any hard spots stay, we renovate the job at no extra cost to you. We had some family coming to remain for graduation weekend and we required a new water heater before they arrived. We searched for a bit, however we got the best quotes from Blue Frog. They had the ability to send someone out within a day approximately. He was really friendly and great. He said our expenses must be lower now too.</p>
