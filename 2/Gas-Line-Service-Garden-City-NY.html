<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners remove calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water saves you money. Reduced Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>
<p>Strainers are suggested prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire battling water lines. No strainer is to be utilized in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance coverage Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
