Generally, this is since the system is obsoleted or not working appropriately. Whatever the factor, you can be losing out on the advantages of soft water without even knowing it.</p>

<p>Frequently caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl.
