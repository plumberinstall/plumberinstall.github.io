<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for carrying out yearly forward flow tests are often perceived as a mandate to have them.

For residential property, it is essential for owners to alert the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial property, the District evaluates making use of each new occupant. The correction should be made prior to water service is allowed if the existing backflow is not up to District code.
