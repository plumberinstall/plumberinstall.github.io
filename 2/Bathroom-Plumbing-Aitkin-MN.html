However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of detergents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be tough.</p>

<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less critical things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
