<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals expect to see however rarely stop to think about.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
