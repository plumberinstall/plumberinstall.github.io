<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
