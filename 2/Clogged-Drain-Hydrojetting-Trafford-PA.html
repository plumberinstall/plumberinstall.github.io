If your home was developed before the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you hire a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. If your home was constructed decades before that, opportunities are that your home may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimal rates.</p>
