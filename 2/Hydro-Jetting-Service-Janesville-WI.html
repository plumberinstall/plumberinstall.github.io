<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation.
