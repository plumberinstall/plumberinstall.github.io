<p>If the toilet can not be fixed, or if the repair cost approaches replacement cost, we'll discuss your alternatives. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular method of clearing obstructions. They generally utilize sulfuric acid or salt hydroxide to liquify gunky accumulation. While reliable at getting rid of blockages, they might do your plumbing more harm than great. Here are 3 reasons to avoid pouring these severe chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the useful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Numerous homes in my community being repiped and have spoken to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't found soon, obviously it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger major damage.</p>
