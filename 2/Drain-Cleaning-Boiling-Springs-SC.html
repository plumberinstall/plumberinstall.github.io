Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled.
