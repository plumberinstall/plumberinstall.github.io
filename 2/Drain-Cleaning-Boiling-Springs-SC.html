For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain.
