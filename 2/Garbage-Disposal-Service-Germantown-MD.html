Choosing a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is recommended. The energy performance of a storage water heater is indicated by its Energy Aspect (EF). The more efficient the hot water heater the higher the EF rating. Nevertheless, just because a water heater has a higher EF value, it does not always indicate it will have lower operating expense. You also need to consider the fuel source.</p>
