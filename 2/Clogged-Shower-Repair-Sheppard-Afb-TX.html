<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Sheppard Afb TX</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely uncommon cases where the building is considered to not present a risk to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
