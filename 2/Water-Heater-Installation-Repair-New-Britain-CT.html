<p>One typical method for a home's water supply to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.
