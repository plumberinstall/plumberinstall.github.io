<p>Backflow is a possible problem in a water supply due to the fact that it can spread out infected water back through a distribution system. For instance, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any real or possible connection between the public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow contaminants or contaminants to get in the potable water system. Sickness can result from ingesting water that has actually been polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>The California Code of Laws, Title 17, mandates water purveyors, such as EBMUD, to administer a cross-connection control prevention program, which helps keep potable water from contaminant and contaminant direct exposure.

Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
