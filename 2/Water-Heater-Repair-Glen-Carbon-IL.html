<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
