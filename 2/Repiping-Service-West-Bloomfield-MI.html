Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
