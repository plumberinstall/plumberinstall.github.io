<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Kernersville NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
