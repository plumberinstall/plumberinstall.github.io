Pointer: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, get rid of the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before mounting the disposal. Also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
