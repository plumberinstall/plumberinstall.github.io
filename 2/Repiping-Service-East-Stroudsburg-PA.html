<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
