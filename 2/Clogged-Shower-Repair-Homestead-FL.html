<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not pose a danger to the water supply, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
