<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a property owner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department need to satisfy or go beyond the state requirements and bring the obligation for implementing them.</p>

Many water looks alike - however inside a clear glass of water there thousands of liquified minerals which are completely undetectable to your naked eye.
