<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
