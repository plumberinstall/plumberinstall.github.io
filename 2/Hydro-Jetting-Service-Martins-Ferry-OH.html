<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it too.</p>
