<p>A guideline is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
