<p>When a gas line is ruptured, it right away ends up being a major security threat. Without being repaired as rapidly as possible, it could trigger quite a bit of damage if the gas inside becomes fired up. If an individual realizes that they have burst a gas line, the first concern is to shut off the supply of gas and call the energy company.</p>
<p>One common way for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread exponentially. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in individual homes, it also avoids wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and contaminating the public water system.</p>
