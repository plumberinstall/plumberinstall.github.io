If these connections are not appropriately safeguarded, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>When per year to clean out the drains and keep whatever running efficiently, we advise that house owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least.
