<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Franklin LA</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it too.</p>
<p>Depending upon the extent of the clog, we may use a range of different methods, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative form of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to totally clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and remove wire connectors. Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp port and eliminate wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
