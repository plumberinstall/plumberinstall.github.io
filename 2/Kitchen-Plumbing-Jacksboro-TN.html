<p>It is common for hot water heater to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve belongs to the unit for that specific reason. But while little drips should not be trigger for concern, property owners should keep an eye on the water heater leakages. I had an excellent experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we needed a leak in a pipe repaired. Tom was friendly and professional. He also did the job faster than initial estimated, so the work was cheaper than I expected. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions except directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each place where you will have a gas home appliance should have a gas shutoff valve.

All gas piping installations need a permit and inspection.</p>
