<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Georgetown OH</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
