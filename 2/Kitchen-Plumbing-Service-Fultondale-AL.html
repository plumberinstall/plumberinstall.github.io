It is extremely tough to judge such claims, which are nearly never ever based upon tests that are well sufficient explained to allow others to assess them and to confirm the outcomes. While the absence of "scientific" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it needs to make one think twice to accept it without some assurance of efficiency.</p>
<p>It's a great idea to arrange annual inspections if your plumbing system is decades old and if you understand that you have a history of leaking or clogging. Test.
