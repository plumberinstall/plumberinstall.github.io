<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
