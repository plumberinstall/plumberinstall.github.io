<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Did you know that your kitchen sink is amongst the most pre-owned items in your house? Washing dishes is simply the start. Stop and think about that for a moment. Baby baths, family pet baths, watering plants, food prep, prep for entertaining, hand washing fragile items, and mopping just to name a few tasks. Repetitive use might indicate you experience problems.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
