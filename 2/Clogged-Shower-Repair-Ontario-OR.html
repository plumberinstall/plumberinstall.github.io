<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Ontario OR</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.

A basic by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
