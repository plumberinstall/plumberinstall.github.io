<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
