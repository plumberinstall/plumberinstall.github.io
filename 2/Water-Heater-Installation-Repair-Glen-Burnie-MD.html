Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
