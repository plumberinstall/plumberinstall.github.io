<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
