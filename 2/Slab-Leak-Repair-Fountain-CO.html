For instance, a kitchen sink might include as many as 6 different systems simply to offer the total service we anticipate. Like any machine, a sink has numerous parts that need maintenance and repair in time.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
