<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal can be found in 2 basic types - constant feed, which usually has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which needs a food cover be in location to run the system.
