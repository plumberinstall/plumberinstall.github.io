<p>Toilet flush handles are another part of a toilet that can cause toilets to keep running. Typically handles are toilet parts that get loose or rusty and no longer pull the flap up or drop it pull back appropriately. It's a simple repair, however there's a trick to getting the flush deal with out. The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Image 1). Then get rid of the old handle and lever, slide the brand-new deal with into place, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten by relying on the right (Image 2).</p>
