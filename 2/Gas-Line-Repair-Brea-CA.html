I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters.

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades.

This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
