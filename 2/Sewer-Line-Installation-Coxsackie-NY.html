<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
