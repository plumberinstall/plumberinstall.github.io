<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in North Highlands CA 95660?</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear.
