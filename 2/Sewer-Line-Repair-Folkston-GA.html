<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Folkston GA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
