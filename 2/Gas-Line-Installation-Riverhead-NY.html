Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. Nevertheless, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange happen? There is one other essential element needed to make the procedure work: a resin bed consisting of lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>Installing a salt-based softener or water softener alternative offers much better, much safer drinking water. When showering in conditioned or softened water you will enjoy healthier skin and hair.
