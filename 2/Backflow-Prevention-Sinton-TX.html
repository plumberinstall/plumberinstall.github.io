<p>Homeowners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is especially sensible to set up inspections on an annual basis and when purchasing a new home. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the baking soda and vinegar mix, an enzyme treatment will also keep pipes running smoothly. Enzymes are bacteria that feed upon raw material, such as hair, mold, algae and other common clog-causers. This natural solution is effective and safe. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to purchase our recommended enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>While city water does get dealt with, it is done for purposes of eliminating bacterial problems and making the water drinkable. These are certainly concerns for a town and its citizens but hard water can negatively impact faucets and home appliances in a home. With the high calcium material of local water, it can cause a dishwasher or hot water heater to malfunction.</p>

<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>

Job well done: You don't wish to wind up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the task to a qualified plumber ensures a smooth installation procedure.</p>
