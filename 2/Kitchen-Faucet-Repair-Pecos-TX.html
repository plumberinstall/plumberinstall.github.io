<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective operating a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
<p>While city water does get treated, it is provided for purposes of eliminating bacterial issues and making the water drinkable.

<p>Your hot water heater. The pro will next inspect your hot water heater. With your hot water heater, he or she is taking a look at water temperature, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ).

To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to rinse out any buildup.</p>
