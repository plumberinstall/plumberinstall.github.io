Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
