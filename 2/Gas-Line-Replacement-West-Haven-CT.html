<p>Do not put everything down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to view what you put down your waste disposal unit.

Additionally, grease and oil can collect and congeal in your drain also. After finishing cooking, consider putting leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
