<p>Inspect the house's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a family of four must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated up and offered for usage.

Demand that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of deterioration.</p>
