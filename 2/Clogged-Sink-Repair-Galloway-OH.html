<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
