<p>Unless you have a wily two-year old who enjoys to throw toilet tissue down the toilet, you need to not have frequent obstructing problems.

If you are having a toilet that obstructs constantly and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing regularly, then it's most likely time for a new toilet.

In either case, you need to call us for a home plumbing inspection without delay.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Although it may be tempting to gather over the counter drain-clearing items, numerous plumbers advise against it. Not just are the chemicals hazardous if exposed to human skin, they might also damage drain pipes if excessive used.

From there we can make an informed decision on whether your problem can be resolved by a simple repair or if changing the waste disposal unit is eventually the much better alternative.</p>
