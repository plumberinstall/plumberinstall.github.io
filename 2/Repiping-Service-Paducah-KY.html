<p>When the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly.
