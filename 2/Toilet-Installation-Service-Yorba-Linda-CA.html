I selected this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
