<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
