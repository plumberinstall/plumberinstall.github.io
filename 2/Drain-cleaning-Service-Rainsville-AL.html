<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Rainsville AL 35986</h3>
<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation appointment. Setting up natural gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As hard water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause tough water adhere to the beads, and the treated water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas. However, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still occur.</p>
