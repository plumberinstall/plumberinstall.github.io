If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>If you see nothing apparent, place the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the system, and twist best and left. Inspect that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then try the reset button if the motor spins freely. If these measures do not work, and your disposer's guarantee has actually ended, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>Pieces that make up kitchen sink drains can end up being used and rusty, resulting in leakages. Depending on the intensity of the circumstance, only one piece might need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be eliminated and changed.

Incorrectly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>
