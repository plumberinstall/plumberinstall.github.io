<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing an interruption, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go on and replace the entire line. Definitely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench.
