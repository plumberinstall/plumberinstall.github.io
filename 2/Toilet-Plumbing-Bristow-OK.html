<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

When the water is very tough and it is utilized greatly, the costs of softening will increase.</p>
