<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Typically, the savings have been based largely on decreasing chemical and cleaning agent expenses. While those cost savings are still considerable, brand-new commercial softening innovation utilizing multi-tank systems (MTS) also provides significant water and salt cost savings.</p>
