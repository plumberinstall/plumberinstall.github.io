Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
