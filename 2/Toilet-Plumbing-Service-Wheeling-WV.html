<p>E.R. Services comprehends the significance of maintaining the stability and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you discover weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your system, this could be a sign that sediment has built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component.
