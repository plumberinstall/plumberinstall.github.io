<p>You are responsible for fixing or replacing the assembly within 30 days if your assembly stops working the yearly test. All replacements should be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right kind of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly should meet the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be terminated until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical substance that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
