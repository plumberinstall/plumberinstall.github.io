<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived throughout the selected period. They unplugged the sinks, tidied up and recommended a tool to be utilized in the future. How do you understand if it's time to call for sewer line repair or replacement? Keep an eye out for several clogged drains in your home, overflowing or backed up toilets, or water spots on your walls and foundation.</p>
