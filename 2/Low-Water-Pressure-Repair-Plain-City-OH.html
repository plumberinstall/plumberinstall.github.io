Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
