<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>
