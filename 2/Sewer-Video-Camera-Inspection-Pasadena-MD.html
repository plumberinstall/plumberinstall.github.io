<p>If the toilet can not be repaired, or if the repair cost approaches replacement cost, we'll discuss your options. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular method of clearing clogs. They generally make use of sulfuric acid or salt hydroxide to liquify gunky build-up. While reliable at removing blockages, they might do your plumbing more damage than good. Here are 3 reasons to avoid pouring these severe chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>You need to have electrical energy in order for this type of water heater to operate.

The average cost to run a gas line is $355 to $743, whereas complex jobs are $1,000 and up. New gas line installation costs $12 to $25 per direct foot, consisting of labor, materials, piping, and allows.
