<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Provided there isn't a tank failure, normally a commercial water heater can be repaired, but is it worth repairing? Just after responding to the following questions must you answer repair or replace. Do you know how many years old your hot water heater is? Do you understand how many years it's rated for? Think about replacement instead of repair if it is close to the number of years the water heater was rated for.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
