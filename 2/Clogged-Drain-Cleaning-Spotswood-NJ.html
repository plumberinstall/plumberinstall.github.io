Most of toilets are basic sized - suggesting a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely shaped bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It truly isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight uniformly and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
