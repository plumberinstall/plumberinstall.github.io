Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause jams and clogs - consider composting or putting these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and collect in your drain also.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
