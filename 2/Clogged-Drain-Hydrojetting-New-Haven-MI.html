<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
