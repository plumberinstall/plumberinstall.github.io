These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
