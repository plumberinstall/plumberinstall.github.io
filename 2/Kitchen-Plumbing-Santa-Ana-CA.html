<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
