<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
