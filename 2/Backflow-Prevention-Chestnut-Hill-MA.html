<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
