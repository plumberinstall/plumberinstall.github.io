For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
