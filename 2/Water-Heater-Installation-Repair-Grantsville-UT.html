<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective working a need more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
