<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
