<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low.

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
