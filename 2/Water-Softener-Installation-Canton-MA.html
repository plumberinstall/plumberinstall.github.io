<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
