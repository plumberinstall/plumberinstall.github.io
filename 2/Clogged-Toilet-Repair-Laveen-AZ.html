<p>If you presume your toilet has a leak, fortunately is that it doesn't necessarily require a repair of your whole system. A toilet's tank is made up of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts break, they lead to small leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
