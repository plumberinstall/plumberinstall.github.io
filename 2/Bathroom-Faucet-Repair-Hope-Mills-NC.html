<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the option with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is free of solidity ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
