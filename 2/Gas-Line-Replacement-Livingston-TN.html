<p>I can't say enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a really brief amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Each and every single individual I experienced from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew.

All of the people I encountered were role models for what a well run service company should be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're excellent.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to identify water sources and scenarios that require backflow prevention gadgets. For residential property, it is important for owners to inform the District if any changes are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial property, the District reviews the use of each new renter. If the current backflow is not up to District code, the correction must be made before water service is allowed. Cost for the device is covered by either the property or the tenant owner.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
