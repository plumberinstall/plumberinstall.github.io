<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
