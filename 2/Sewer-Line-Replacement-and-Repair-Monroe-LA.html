Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
