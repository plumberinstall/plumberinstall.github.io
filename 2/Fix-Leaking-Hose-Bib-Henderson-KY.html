<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
