<p>Once the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
