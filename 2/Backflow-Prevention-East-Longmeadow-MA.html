Whole-house repiping can certainly be a large undertaking, which is why the service is just performed when definitely needed. Initially, your plumber will choose which piping product to use for the task, either copper or plastic. Changing and setting up new pipes can take anywhere in between 3-5 days depending on the size of your house.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
