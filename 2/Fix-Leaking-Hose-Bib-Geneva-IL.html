<p>Whether a supply of water is identified "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the existence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium.

When your drains are clogged, you will probably start to see gurgling noises, water backing up into your sink or shower, or strange smells.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
