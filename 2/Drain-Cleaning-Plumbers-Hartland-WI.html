<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Hartland WI</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it as well.</p>

<p>A typical whole-house repipe can take anywhere from 3 to 5 days, depending upon the size of the home, the number of levels it has actually and the selected pipe material.
