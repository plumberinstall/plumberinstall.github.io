<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
