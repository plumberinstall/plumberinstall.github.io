A RainSoft water conditioner can assist your water heater last longer. Required to install, change, reconstruct, or repair any plumbing system, gas system, sprinkler system supply, hot water heater replacement.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
