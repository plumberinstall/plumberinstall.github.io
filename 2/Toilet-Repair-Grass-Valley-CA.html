<p>No, you need to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're severe about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be even more harmful than handy, possibly eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's whole plumbing system, consisting of both water supply and drain lines. Generally, a whole-house repipe deserves the financial investment in the long run due to the fact that it may address the root reason for the persistent plumbing problems in your house.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
