For instance, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any real or possible connection between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow toxins or contaminants to get in the safe and clean water system. Sickness can arise from ingesting water that has actually been polluted due to backflow.</p>
