<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
