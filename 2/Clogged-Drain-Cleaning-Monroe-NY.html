<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
<p>We have two no-dig methods to repair your sewer line: CIPP and pipe bursting. We total CIPP repairs without any excavation. Pipe bursting requires minimal digging.
