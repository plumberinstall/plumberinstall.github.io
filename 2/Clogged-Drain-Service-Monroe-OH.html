<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would normally cause rust. After extended usage, these rods will eventually become worn and need to be replaced.

<p>Galvanized steel potable water supply and circulation pipes are typically discovered with small pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is hardly ever utilized today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently recognized merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably costly, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications. It is also very resilient and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most extensively used pipe material for fire sprinklers and gas.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
