<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you should probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
