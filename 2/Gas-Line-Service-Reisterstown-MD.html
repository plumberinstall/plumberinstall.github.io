This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

<p>Depending upon what part of the world you're from you may have heard sink disposals referred to as garbage disposals," food waste disposers," or, if you're truly correct, a sink waste disposal unit."

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
