To prevent this catastrophe, make certain to utilize your gas stoves precisely as instructed and never to utilize them to heat your house. The same goes for portable gas stoves, which are to be used outdoors just and not inside. When running the space-heaters, ensure someone is awake to monitor them. Numerous families die in their sleep due to carbon monoxide poisoning overnight. Another preventative measure to take is to never run your generators in enclosed areas.
