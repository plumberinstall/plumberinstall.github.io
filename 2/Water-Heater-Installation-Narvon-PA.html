Sediment Accumulation: If you discover odd popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element. Running out of warm water rapidly is another sign of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
