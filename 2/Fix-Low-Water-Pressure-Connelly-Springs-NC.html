<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Connelly Springs NC 28612?</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
