<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
