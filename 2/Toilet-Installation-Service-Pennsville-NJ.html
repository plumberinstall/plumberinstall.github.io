<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It's important to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise cause blockages and jams - consider composting or positioning these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and collect in your drain as well. After ending up cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
