<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by getting rid of an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these components not only dry your skin and hair but also build up in appliances and pipes reducing their efficiency and life expectancy. Your washing dishwasher, machine and water heater are all negatively affected by hard water. The effects of hard water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothing, the film on your shower door and even your personal appearance and comfort.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
