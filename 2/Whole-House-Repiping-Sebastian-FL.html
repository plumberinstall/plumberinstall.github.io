Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>
