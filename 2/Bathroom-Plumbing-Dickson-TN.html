Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to likewise be offered.</p>

This makes sure that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems stays detached from clean" water.</p>
