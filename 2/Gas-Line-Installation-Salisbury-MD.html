<p>Our team at All Stage Plumbing also uses drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a resilient and exceptional option for your broken pipes. The pipe lining process involves our group saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is entirely filled, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and flaws. If heat is used, the liner is left to harden in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes. When the procedure is total, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be inspected one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
