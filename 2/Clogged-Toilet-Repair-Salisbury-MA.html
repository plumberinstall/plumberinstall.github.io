<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
