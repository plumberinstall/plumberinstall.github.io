<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
