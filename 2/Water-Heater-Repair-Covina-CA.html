<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other locations of your home. A sewage smell emanating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indication of a severe problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. It is essential that you get in touch with a certified plumber if there is a consistent sewage smell in your house. Raw sewage is extremely dangerous and can present major health dangers.</p>
<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can occur gradually from the accumulation of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog becomes bigger over time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining appropriately.
