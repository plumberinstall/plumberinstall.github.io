<p>If you have actually constantly resided in an area with difficult water, you may not understand just how much it affects you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too aware of the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to utilize more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red frequently.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be a concern when used in fighting a fire. Firefighters by and large are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are concerning with protecting individuals's lives and to a lower degree their residential or commercial property.

Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
