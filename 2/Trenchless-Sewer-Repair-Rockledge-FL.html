<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).
