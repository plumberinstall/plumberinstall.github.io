Products that would otherwise enter the garbage ought to not be placed in your disposal. This consists of glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything flammable, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complex than replacing with a various design.

When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to link wires accurately, and the base covered to protect the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
