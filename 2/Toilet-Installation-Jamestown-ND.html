<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
