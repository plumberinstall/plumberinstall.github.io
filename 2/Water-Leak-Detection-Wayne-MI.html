Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes lots of small moving parts that might need changed with usage in time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and trigger toilet leakages that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
