Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to weld or spot a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to save cash. While this might operate in the short-term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same material as other pipes in your house, meaning that trouble could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you peace of mind and prevent larger leakages down the roadway.</p>
