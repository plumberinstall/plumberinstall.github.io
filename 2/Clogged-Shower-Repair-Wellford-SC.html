More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure might require replacing the hot water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
