More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure might require replacing the hot water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
