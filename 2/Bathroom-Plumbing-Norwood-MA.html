The beads accelerate the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely eliminate short-lived firmness in water.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. However not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
