<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

When a Notice of Correction" or Notice of Requirement" is provided, failure to install or correct an installation and then evaluate a backflow assembly may result in service interruption or termination.</p>
