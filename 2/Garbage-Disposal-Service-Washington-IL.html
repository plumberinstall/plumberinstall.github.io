<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in joists, floorings, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the task with insurance claims, wasted time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>
