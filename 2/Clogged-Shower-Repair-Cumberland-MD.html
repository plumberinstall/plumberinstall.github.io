<p>To identify if your home is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it enters the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water main. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Drains clog for a factor, but it's not always apparent. It is strongly suggested that a professional plumber carry out a camera inspection on a main sewer line after it has clogged. If you're purchasing a home, this is two times as important. Picture in the above scenario knowing the condition of the line prior to the purchase of a home. You can't constantly be particular whether the home has had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous property owner understood the factor for the clog A basic camera inspection could make you familiar with a concealed and very expensive  issue prior to the purchase.</p>
