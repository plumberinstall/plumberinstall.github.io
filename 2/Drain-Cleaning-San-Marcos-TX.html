<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away.

The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
