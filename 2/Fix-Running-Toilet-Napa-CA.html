<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
