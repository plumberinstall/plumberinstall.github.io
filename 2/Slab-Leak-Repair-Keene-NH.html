<h3>Find Registered Plumbers in  Keene NH</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very rare cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a threat to the water system, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
