The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank.

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.
