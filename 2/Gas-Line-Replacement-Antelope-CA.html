<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractor in Antelope</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates professional inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is manually manipulated on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor.

The information we obtain from the inspection permits us to make a notified choice concerning the condition of your pipes and suggest the very best option too.
