If your house was constructed before the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you hire a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was constructed decades prior to that, opportunities are that your house may need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at optimum rates.</p>

As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is connected.
