<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>You most likely understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your sinks, tubs, and showers to a local water treatment center.
