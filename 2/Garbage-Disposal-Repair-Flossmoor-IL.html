<p>E.R. Services understands the value of keeping the stability and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge.

However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is one other essential component needed to make the procedure work: a resin bed including lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>While city water does get treated, it is done for functions of eliminating bacterial concerns and making the water drinkable.
