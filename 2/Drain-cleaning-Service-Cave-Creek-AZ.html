I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
