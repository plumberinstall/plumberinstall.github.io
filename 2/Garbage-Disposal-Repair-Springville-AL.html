<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>You hear water dripping or running in the tank. A backflow happens when water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water supply. The water streaming in reverse from a cross-connection may infect the drinking water system. Yard irrigation systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs are common cross-connection points.
