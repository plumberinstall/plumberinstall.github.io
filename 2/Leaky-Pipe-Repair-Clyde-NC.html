<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

They significantly minimize your water heating costs because there is no tank" of water for the system to constantly heat and re-heat all day.

<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical service, specifically when easy plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
