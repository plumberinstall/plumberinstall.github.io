<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
