<p>This might sound like a joke, however it's very severe if you want to really get the most out of your financial investment. Start by asking for a copy of the plumbing inspection checklist.

<p>Many house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their clogged or filthy drain problems. These chemicals are easy to utilize and low-cost, but they damage your pipes and their results are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize extreme chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will likewise eat away at the pipe creating weak spots that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly recommended.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
