It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a properly working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be provided.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in difficult water can trigger a bad smell and taste.
