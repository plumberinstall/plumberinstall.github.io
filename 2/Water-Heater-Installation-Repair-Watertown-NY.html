<p>I have actually been impressed with your company and its individuals from the day your sales person walked in here, through all service personel, and now. By the method, this is a great system. Our energy costs are much lower then before, the air flow is practically undetectable, the air temperature within is even, the humidity contstant, and we have had no failures since installation.</p>
<p>Have non-testable" backflow devices replaced at the intervals explained above. Have testable" backflow assemblies checked annual and rebuilt or replaced as needed (generally every 5-8 years).

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>In regards to the devices that will be examined, there are two possible choices: a reduced pressure concept device or check valves. Both include a mechanical backflow preventer - essentially, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were wonderful at repairing the clogged drain, however extremely very careless about repairing the chip in the sink and making use of puddy under the sink.</p>
