<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly when water is hard. Water softening can avoid these unfavorable effects. Natural gas is a colorless, odorless fuel.

Because most of the pipes in your home are hidden, it's almost impossible to take a look at the condition of your pipes and it is often hard to identify a problem before it's too late.
