<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products including harsh chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your warm water appears rusty, this could be an indicator that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and may begin leaking soon. You can look at this by filling a number of five-gallon buckets with your water.
