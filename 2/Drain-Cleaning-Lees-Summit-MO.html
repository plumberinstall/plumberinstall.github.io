<p>The most efficient way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is a sudden reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire combating or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This turnaround can produce a suction impact and draw potential pollutants into the potable (drinking) water supply. Storage tank water heaters are typically found in many homes. Their components are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's required. A pipe emerges from the top to provide hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
