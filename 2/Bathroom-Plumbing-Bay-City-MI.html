<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
