<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely uncommon cases where the structure is deemed to not position a threat to the water system, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

<p>Hot water heater diagnostics: We determine what is incorrect with your hot water heater, as well as what maintenance work needs to be performed progressing. Water softeners normally utilize sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are provided from dissolved sodium chloride salt, likewise called brine. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>You most likely understand something about your drains: they take water from your sinks, bath tubs, and showers to a local water treatment facility.

That's where a professional plumber is available in-- they have the proficiency to diagnose a problem and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
