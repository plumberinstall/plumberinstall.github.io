And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with house owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are certain contaminants that residents are dealing with and an RO can help reduce those issues. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally happens in some soils and that too can be corrected with the best RO system.</p>
