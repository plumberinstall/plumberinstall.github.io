<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
