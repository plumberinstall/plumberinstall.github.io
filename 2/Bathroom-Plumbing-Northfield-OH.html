Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
