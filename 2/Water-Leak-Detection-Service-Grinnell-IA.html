Diane Heether is a city resident of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener installed in her home. It didn't just enhance and make cleaning much easier, but it helps reduce waste as well. Once it has passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement created to prevent the turnaround of the circulation of water. The two types of pipes that we prefer to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 extremely different materials, however they both have extraordinary toughness and longevity.</p>
