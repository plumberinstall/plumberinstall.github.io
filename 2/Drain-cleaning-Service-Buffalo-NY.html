The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.

When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
