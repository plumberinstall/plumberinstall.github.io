<p>To identify if your home is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can likewise be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it gets in the house near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
