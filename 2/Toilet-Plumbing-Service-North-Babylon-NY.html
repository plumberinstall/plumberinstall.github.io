<p>It is not always due to blockages that originate inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, plastic, clay or copper, will figure out the extent of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>

If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater very quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
