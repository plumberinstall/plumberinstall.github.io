<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions.
