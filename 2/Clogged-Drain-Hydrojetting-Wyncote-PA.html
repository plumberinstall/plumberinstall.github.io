<p>There are 2 kinds of piping that are used in the repiping procedure. Because of their cost, safety and effectiveness, copper piping and PEX piping are used.

<p>Plumbing is an important part of your house or company, and its ability to function is necessary. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains obstructing, this might be a sign of a larger issue, like a tree root invasion or a big clog. If the drains clog periodically but you can generally flush them out, this may be a smaller clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Small clogs can become big ones relatively quickly.</p>
