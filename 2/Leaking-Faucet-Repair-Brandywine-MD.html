<p>Some pipe materials are more affordable than others; some are more prone and brittle to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
