<p>Hydro jetting works by blasting highly pressurized water through your sewer line, and it is considerably more affordable and reliable than alternative methods of reducing clog in sewer lines. It's so efficient in fact, that Northwest Drain Station uses a no dig-up warranty.

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Among the things we concentrate on is the bathroom toilet. Numerous people and services let the toilet drainage every year with leaking or inefficient models. This is money and a natural resource diminishing the drain. Water conservation in the desert is essential and older toilets can utilize 3.5 gallons of water per flush! Our master technicians will have the ability to restore or replace the toilet the same day most of the times saving you money and time.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next step would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a container below the area to capture water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
