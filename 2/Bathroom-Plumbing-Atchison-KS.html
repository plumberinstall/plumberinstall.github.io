<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
