<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
