<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
