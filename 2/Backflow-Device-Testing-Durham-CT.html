Sanford & Child plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations. During regeneration, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads.
