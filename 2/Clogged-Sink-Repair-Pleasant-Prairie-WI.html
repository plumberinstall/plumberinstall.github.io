<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
