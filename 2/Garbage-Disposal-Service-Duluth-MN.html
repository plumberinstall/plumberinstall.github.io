<p>As a locally-owned company, stability and obligation are incredibly important to developing a track record for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable supply of water within a building these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>

While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
