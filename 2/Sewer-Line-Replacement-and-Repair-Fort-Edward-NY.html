<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing detergent from working effectively due to the fact that difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use increasingly more cleaning agent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized during regrowth. Lastly, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
