It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position.

The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and supply a cautious cleaning.</p>
