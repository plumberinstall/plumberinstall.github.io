<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies New Canaan CT</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly rare cases where the structure is deemed to not position a risk to the supply of water, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>Low Risks: For low risks consisting of fire systems and irrigation systems, City of Bellingham accepts double check detector and check valve assemblies, pressure vacuum breaker assemblies and atmospheric vacuum breakers as kinds of protection.
