<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies New Canaan CT</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly rare cases where the structure is deemed to not position a risk to the supply of water, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
