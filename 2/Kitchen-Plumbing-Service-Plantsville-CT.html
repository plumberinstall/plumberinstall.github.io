<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<p>The very best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities website is by installing a pressure reducing valve (PRV).

<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
