<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
