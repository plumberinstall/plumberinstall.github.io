<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
