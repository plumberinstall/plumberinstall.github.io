<p>There are various causes for obstructions depending on where they occur in your plumbing Toilets clog from excessive toilet paper for the many part. When the toilet paper collects in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet rather of flowing through it, the toilet will not flush. The water just back up in the bowl.

<p>Many house owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their clogged or filthy drain issues. These chemicals are easy to use and affordable, however they harm your pipes and their results are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use extreme chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing vulnerable points that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
