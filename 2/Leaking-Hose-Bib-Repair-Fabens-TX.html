The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to completion of the water main. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the concern if this is the case.
