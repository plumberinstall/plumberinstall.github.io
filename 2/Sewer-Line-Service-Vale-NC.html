<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house, this is one of the very first and main questions that you should ask yourself. The age of your home is a critical element to understand whether you ought to repipe your home.

If your home was built prior to the 1970s, we strongly advise that you hire a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and inspect if there are locations that need repiping.
