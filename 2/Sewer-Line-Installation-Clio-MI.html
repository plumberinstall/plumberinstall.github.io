As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
