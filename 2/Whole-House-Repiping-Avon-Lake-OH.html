<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. Initially, prepare for each device to be set up should be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might use up to 3 weeks or more to approve and process. Rejected strategies should be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can include another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>When utilized in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firefighters by and big are not worried about backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with protecting individuals's lives and to a lower level their residential or commercial property.

<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
