<p>When used in battling a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firemen by and large are not worried about backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser extent their residential or commercial property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source available to achieve that objective. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome suggest that the level of defense on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high danger security level.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, however if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a larger issue to analyze. You might need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is reasonably new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can search for your state's licensing info. Examine the list of state licensing agencies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>It helps to know the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand is normally on the bowl behind the seat. Sometimes, the design or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can end up being an experimental process. Even professional plumbers in some cases try 2 or 3 flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
