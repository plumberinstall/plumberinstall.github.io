<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
