If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
