<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Company in West Warwick</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I've consulted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
