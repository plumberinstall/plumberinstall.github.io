<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently since hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use more and more cleaning agent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected throughout regeneration. Finally, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
