<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
