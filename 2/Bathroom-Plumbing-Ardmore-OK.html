<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue.
