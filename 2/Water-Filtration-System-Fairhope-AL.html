Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
