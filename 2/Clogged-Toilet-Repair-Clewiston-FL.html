<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck.

Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

<h3>Water Softening in Clewiston Florida</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, make sure the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
