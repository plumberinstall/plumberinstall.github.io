It is very important that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade.
