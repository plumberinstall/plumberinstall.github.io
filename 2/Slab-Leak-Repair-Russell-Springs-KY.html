<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Russell Springs KY</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Electrical Breakdowns: Modern water heaters also count on electrical parts. You could be left with no hot water if something inside the unit stops working The discharge line is pressurized and can run some distance. How far is the softener from the washing machine drain? Even a kitchen or bathroom sink drain will make better connection than running outside.</p>
