<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
