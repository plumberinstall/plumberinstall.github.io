For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank.

Where the company is located: Be cautious of contractors who give you a post office box without any street address or use just an answering service.
