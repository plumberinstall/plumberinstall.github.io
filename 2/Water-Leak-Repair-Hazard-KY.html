<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, including bad soil conditions, obstructions from grease and gunk, and rust. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly intensified if pipes have been enabled to freeze.</p>
