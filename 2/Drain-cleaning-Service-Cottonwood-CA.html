<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains.
