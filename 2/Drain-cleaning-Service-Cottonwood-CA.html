<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains.
