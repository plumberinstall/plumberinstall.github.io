<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>We utilize both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping procedure. Copper is the industry standard since it is long enduring and long lasting. We will provide you various choices based on your budget plan and preferences. PEX piping is a new choice that is flexible, resistant to deterioration, and as much as 75 percent less costly than copper piping.</p>
