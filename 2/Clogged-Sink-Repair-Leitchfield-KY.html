<p>Remember that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you ought to only employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs capture moisture so that it doesn't get in the control system. Although little pieces of sediment may get through a drip leg.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still happen.</p>
