<p>Were you to ask many people what word initially springs to mind when they think about a plumbing system, pipe" would certainly be near the top of the list. The pipe is, after all, something of a standard building block of any plumbing system. There are pipes that bring water into your house and provide it throughout the house, and there are those that then get rid of wastewater in a clean and hassle-free  manner. For obvious reasons, you can not afford to take chances with your piping in Delaware County & The Main Line.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
