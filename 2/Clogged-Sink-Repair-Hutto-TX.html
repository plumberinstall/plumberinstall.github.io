<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great person. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as assured. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and supply a mindful cleaning.</p>
