<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's needed. When the tap is changed on, tankless systems particularly make use of a component that heats up water. The water is constantly warmed as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is instantly switched off, the water stops being warmed.

Because they just heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters use less power than traditional water heaters.</p>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the offender. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
