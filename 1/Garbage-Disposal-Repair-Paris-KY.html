<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
