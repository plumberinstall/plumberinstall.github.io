Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
