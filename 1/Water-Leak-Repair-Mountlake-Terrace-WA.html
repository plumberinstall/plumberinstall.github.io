The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your home. Once the brand-new salt has had a possibility to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
