The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
