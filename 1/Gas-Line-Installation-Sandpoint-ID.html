Low Flow Toilets: While low flow toilets are terrific at saving you cash on your water bills, some older models do not have the flushing power to correctly get rid of waste, which causes accumulations.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

Though a sink is a fairly simple system as far as plumbing goes, these fixtures can experience all kinds of problem.

<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a home is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are pretty cheap and easy to install, so there's no factor not to. Eventually triggering a backup when grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and avoids water flow. This added with other particles in your drain can cause a major backup.</p>
