<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements.

If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
