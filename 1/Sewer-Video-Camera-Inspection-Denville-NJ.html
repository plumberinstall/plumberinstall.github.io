<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with tough water, you may not understand how much it affects you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from tough water. Tough water disrupts the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to use more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
