<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to bond or spot a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to conserve cash. While this might operate in the short-term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the very same material as other pipes in your home, implying that trouble could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system.
