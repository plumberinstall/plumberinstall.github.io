It's so old that it is no longer able to press water through the toilet to fully clear the drain. This results in your toilet having a constant clogging issue.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener.
