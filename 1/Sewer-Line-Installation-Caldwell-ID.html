<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there ought to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food items you must most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
