<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in San Anselmo CA 94960</h3>
<p>If you are aiming to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually started to leak, very first consider your choices. A complete sewer pipe replacement might not be needed.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
