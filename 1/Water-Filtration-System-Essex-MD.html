<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>There are health and safety risks one must prevent while dealing with a sewer line project. Methane gas, salmonella, e. coli, giardia - all are found in sewer pipes and may expose employees during the sewer repair procedure. If your Do It Yourself dig strikes a gas line, breathing the gas can damage your body, and there is a threat of fire or surge damage to your residential or commercial property or your neighbor's. Another danger in sewer repair projects is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your safety and health are too essential to risk in a Do It Yourself sewer project! Avoid these security threats by employing a professional plumber.</p>
