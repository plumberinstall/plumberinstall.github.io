<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the potable system supplying the make-up water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible contaminants can then get in the potable water supply. The very best way to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
