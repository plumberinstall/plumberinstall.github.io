<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less crucial things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled.
