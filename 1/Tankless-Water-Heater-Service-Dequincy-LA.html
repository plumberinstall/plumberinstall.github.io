<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they cake to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can produce major drain clogs by twisting around pipes.

You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is happening to your home.</p>
