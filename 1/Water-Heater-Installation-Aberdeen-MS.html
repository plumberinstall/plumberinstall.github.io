<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
