You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
