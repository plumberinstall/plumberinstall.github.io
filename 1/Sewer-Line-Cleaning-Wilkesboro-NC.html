<p>As soon as you have a waste disposal unit appropriately set up, it becomes a long-lasting component in the house.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. If the water turns off, you might have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's changed properly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>We specialize in repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas water heaters, electric hot water heater and tankless hot water heater. Carefully flex the float arm down to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To adjust a float that does not have an arm, see Image 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the outcome of a corroded overflow pipe, worn out flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Offer the experts at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and minimize lost water.</p>
