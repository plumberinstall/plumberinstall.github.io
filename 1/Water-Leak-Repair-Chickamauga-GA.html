<p>If the toilet can not be repaired, or if the repair cost methods replacement cost, we'll discuss your alternatives. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular method of clearing clogs. They typically use sulfuric acid or salt hydroxide to liquify gunky accumulation. While effective at removing obstructions, they might do your plumbing more damage than great. Here are three reasons to avoid pouring these severe chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
