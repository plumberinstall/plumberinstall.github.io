<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a need more than a need.

<p>The very best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by installing a pressure minimizing valve (PRV). A PRV will regulate water pressure as it enters into the home. According to San Diego utilities, a PRV can also help to save water as fixtures in the home will use less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
