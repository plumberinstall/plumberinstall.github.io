It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
