<p>To determine if your home is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black).

<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
