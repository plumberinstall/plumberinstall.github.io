When drains are working effectively that's actually all you need to learn about them, but when something fails, you need to have a deeper understanding of what sort of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the suitable preventative measures if using one of these products.</p>
