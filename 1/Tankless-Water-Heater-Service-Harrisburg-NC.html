<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To avoid this, make sure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>The cost of your average water expense. As water heaters start to break down and become less efficient, they require more energy to heat up the same quantity of water.
