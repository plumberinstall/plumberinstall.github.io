<p>Our plumber groups intend to keep your house and work places efficient, functional and comfy.

<p>Don't put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is essential to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger jams and clogs - think about composting or putting these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can gather and cake in your drain as well. After completing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
