<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
