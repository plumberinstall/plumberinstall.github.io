High energy costs? It may be time for a new warm water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it installed effectively. A hot water heater that is not installed properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>

<p>Leaking gas can lead to asphyxiation and dangerous surges. Fortunately, commercial gasses, such as the kind a gas stove or heater uses, have a strong odor contributed to them so that leaks can be more easily spotted by house owners.

<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not threat working with an inferior plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and complicate the task with insurance claims, wasted time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
