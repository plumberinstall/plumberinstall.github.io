Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
