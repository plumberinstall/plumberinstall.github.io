Reduced Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is an unexpected decrease in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire battling or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can create a suction impact and draw potential contaminants into the safe and clean (drinking) water supply. Storage tank water heaters are typically found in a lot of houses. Their parts are an insulated tank, usually holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water till it's needed.
