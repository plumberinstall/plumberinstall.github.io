These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>The calcium from limestone is the major factor to the solidity of Woodbury's water. Because it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes, solidity can appear as a nuisance when water is boiled or dried from a drip. It likewise hinders soap and cleaning agent usage. People with really soft water can use smaller sized quantities of soap and detergent for washing.</p>
