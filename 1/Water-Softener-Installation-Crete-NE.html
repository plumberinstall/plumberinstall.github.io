<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
