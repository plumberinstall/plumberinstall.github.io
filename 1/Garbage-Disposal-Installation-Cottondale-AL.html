<p>Aside from these two crucial elements, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the culprit. However not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Plumbers normally start as apprentices. From there, they make a journey and test plumbing license, and ultimately be awarded a master plumbing license. Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is typically ground zero for blockages. As hair integrates with soap, it can create the ideal storm for plumbing blockages. Gradually, these blockages can get worse and prevent your bathtub from draining pipes at all.</p>
