Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water supply within a building these devices are called isolation" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to supply one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
