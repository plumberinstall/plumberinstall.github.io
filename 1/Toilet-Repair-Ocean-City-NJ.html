<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Ocean City NJ</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
