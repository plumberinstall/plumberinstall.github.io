<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
