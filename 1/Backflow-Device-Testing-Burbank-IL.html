Camera are useful in finding buried septic systems or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to determine appropriate maintenance schedules or the extent of essential repairs. When the corrupt salesperson takes control of the camera, he may play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in extremely bad condition and state it is your pipe.</p>
