<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water supply exceeds the pressure in the potable system offering the make-up water. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Potential contaminants can then enter the potable water system. The best method to decrease accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no adverse effects and are, in truth, necessary day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the rejuvenating taste many people find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they accumulation on contact surface areas, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the efficiency of soaps and cleaning agents. At this point the water is said to be hard.</p>
<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program secures the general public supply of water from pollutants and pollutants that could, under certain scenarios, be drawn into the public supply of water from personal properties. If you need a new toilet, the cost largely depends upon the toilet you select. Toilets differ in style, flushing effectiveness and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more expensive than others. When installing a new toilet, the plumber may also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the task.</p>
