<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 utilised to get rid of wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the oldest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had quickly removable and exchangeable sections, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
