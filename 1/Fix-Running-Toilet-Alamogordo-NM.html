<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

To prevent this, ensure the new waste disposal unit installation kit includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>
