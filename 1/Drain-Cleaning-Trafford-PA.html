<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter freezing.

Depending upon the scope of work being performed and the type of structure, you may have one or more inspections.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or short-term connection in between a public water supply or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
