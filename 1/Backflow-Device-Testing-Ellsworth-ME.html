<p>When used in battling a fire, fire department connections can be a problem. Firefighters by and large are not worried about backflow prevention issues. They are worrying about protecting people's lives and to a lesser extent their residential or commercial property. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source readily available to achieve that objective. This can develop cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome mean that the level of defense on the fire protection system might need to be increased to a high danger security level.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Bureau's primary focus is on security within a structure. Plumbing inspections guarantee that water supply in buildings are linked effectively, without any cross-connection to infect drinkable water supply. Fixtures must be appropriately trapped, to prevent sewer gas from leaving into a buildings. Hot water heaters are likewise checked to ensure that they have been installed effectively, to avoid an explosion.</p>
<p>When a plumbing permit has been released in mistake because of inaccurate, incomplete or incorrect details, or the work for which the authorization was issued breaks the Uniform Code, such permit shall be revoked or suspended till such time as the permit holder demonstrates that all work finished and all work proposed shall remain in compliance with appropriate arrangements of the code.</p>
