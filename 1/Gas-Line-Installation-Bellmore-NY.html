<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was very happy with their service.</p>
