<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
