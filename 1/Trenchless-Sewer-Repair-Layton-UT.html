If your plumber needs a permit to repair the gas leak, which they'll most likely need to carry out in the Atlanta city area, the costs to pull the license will add to your repair cost. Although the life expectancy of your home's pipes varies due to a plethora of factors (including wear and tear and whether you reside in a cold-weather environment), an excellent rule of thumb is to replace them if they are 50-years-old or older.</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roof vents or pull out a toilet. This is usually more labor-intensive and might require additional costs. This is also not as efficient due to the fact that the drain machine loses torque the further you are far from the clog.
