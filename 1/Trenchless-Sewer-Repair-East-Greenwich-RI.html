<p>On and off does any structural damage happen as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is generally identified prior to it triggers any significant damage. The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole. This little hole allows water to continuously leak out very gradually. In time it can result in a considerable develop of water.
