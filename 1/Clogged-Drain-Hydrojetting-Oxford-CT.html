<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit.

Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it might need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
