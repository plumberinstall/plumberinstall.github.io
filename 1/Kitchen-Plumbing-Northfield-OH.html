It can take a DIYer a great deal of time to find and total easy repairs, so think about that with the cost when trying to manage the issue by yourself. The factor a toilet won't flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain underneath the toilet can also be the cause. Hiring a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your first step; a plumber can identify the concern and repair it.</p>
<p>This is extremely crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system.
