<p>Most vehicles have a metal line that runs the length of the vehicle with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine. Fixing a leaking fuel line is a simple job for a repair facility and costs in between $60 and $120. Lavacot says it can easily be done at home by the semi-advanced mechanic.

Typically, relining your existing pipes is a much better alternative. If your sewer lines are beneath trees, near substantial landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent functions, total sewer excavation can trigger a lot of civilian casualties (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>
