<h3>Water Heater Repair in Green Bay Wisconsin</h2>
<p>If a gas water heater or an electrical system is more cost-effective, house owners frequently ask. The answer depends upon your home. While gas designs are cheaper to run, they do require an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electric hot water heater is typically lower, but it can be more costly to operate.

<p>Some makers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
