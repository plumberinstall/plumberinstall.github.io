<p>To determine if your house is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it gets in the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is attached to completion of the water pipe. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an important part of your home or service, and its ability to function is essential. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this could be a sign of a bigger issue, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog.
