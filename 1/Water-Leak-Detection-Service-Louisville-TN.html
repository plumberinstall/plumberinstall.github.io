<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in exceptionally unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not position a risk to the water supply, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
