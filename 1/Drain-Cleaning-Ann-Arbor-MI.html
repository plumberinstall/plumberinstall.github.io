<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water.

When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals.
