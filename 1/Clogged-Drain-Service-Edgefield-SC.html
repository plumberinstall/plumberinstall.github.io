<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
