<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right now.

You can check out our License page for additional information on acquiring a permit. When you get a license you can commence with the work. However, you should call for inspection prior to you cover or conceal any work.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it pertains to pipe repair, the most pricey elements aren't the equipment or products utilized, but the uprooting, lawn and landscaping damage that occurs.</p>
