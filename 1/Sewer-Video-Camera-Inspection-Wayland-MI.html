<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair specialist knows the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
