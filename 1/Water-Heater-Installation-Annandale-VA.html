<p>Before the repair service technician begins the repair process, he should make sure he has actually assessed the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to identify any limiting conditions. Proper security preventative measures need to be followed for appropriate entry if the area is thought about a restricted area. A safe and appropriate work environment may involve the positioning of safety barriers or entry limitations around the work area so the repair professional or the general public around your workspace are not harmed. This could affect the technician's ability to successfully finish the repair if the backflow preventer is installed in a restrictive area.</p>
