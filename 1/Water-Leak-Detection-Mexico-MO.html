Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.

<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Mexico MO</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
