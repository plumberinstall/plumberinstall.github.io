<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
