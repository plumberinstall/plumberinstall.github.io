If a clogged storm drain is not attended to in a timely way, the possibilities are high that it will trigger extra damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>

<p>Many automobiles have a metal line that runs the length of the cars and truck with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine. Fixing a leaking fuel line is an easy task for a repair facility and costs in between $60 and $120. Lavacot states it can quickly be done in your home by the semi-advanced mechanic.
