<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Rockville MD</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
