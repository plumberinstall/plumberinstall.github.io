<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping.

Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and eliminates from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>

<p>A lot of softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to supply some type of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it.

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
