<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the solution is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is necessary to resolve the issue. Other times a more substantial service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to the City of Bellingham.
