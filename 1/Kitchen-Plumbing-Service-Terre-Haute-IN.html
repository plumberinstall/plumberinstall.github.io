<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
