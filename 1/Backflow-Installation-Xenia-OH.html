<p>The program achieves its objective by offering the adoption and promulgation of suitable rules and guidelines for the construction of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy costs? It might be time for a brand-new hot water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it installed correctly. A hot water heater that is not installed correctly can result in water damage, scalding temperature levels, or even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Water could be leaking onto the pilot light flame.
