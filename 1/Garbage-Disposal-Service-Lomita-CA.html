<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Lomita CA</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
