<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: bring wastewater out of a home or building. Most folks replace their water heaters due to bad efficiency, total failure or as a preventive step. If your hot water heater is more than 10 years old, it's time to consider replacing it with a more effective model. Water on the floor can mean worn parts. Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the everyday costs and disappointments incurred by tough water, a water softener is ultimately a financial investment that will conserve you a considerable amount of money.
