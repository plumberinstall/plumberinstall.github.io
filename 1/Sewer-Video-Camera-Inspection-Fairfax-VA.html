<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
