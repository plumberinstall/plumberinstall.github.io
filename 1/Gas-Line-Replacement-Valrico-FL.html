I chose this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task tidying up after it as well.</p>
