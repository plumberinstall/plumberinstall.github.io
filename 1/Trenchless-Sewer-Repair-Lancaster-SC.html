<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for a lot of building and construction contractors (or their workers).

This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>High water pressure also damages plumbing. The water coming into the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water turned off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure leads to leakages, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to take place without proper pressure decrease. You can also minimize salt, water, and energy by using approximately 50% less detergent for laundry and dish-washing, using up to 34% less salt and as much as 35% less water throughout regeneration.</p>
