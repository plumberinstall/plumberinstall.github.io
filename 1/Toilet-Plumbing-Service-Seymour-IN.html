<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
