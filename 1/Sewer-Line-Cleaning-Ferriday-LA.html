<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not position a risk to the water supply, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
