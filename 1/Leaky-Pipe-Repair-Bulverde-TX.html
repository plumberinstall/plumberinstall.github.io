When the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly.

As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and flaws. The liner is left to harden in location for several hours or 60 minutes if heat is utilized.
