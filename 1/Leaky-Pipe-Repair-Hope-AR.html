<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
