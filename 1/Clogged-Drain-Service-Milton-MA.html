<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
