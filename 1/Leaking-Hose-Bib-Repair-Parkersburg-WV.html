<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and duty are incredibly important to building a track record for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water supply within a building these gadgets are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no way to supply one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>If you need garbage disposal repair, we can also help. One of our service technicians will pertain to your home to discover the problem and get your disposal working in no time.
