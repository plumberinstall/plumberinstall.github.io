It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly.
