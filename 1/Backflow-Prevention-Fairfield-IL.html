<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the telltale signs of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a shoddy plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>
