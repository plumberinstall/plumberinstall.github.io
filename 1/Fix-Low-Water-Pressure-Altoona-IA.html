<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain because they typically consist of grease and fat. When the fat of the soap integrates with mineral water, it sticks and forms a solid residue to the pipes, obstructing them. Call and set up a follow up inspection by an EBMUD Backflow Inspector to validate that assembly is properly set up. The toilet is the most made use of plumbing fixture in your house. The regular usage of your toilet indicates that plumbing problems will require your timely attention. We offer professional Jacksonville Toilet Repair and Replacement services, and are on call when you need us.</p>
