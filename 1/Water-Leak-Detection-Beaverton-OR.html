<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
