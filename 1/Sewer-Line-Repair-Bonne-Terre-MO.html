<p>As soon as the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
