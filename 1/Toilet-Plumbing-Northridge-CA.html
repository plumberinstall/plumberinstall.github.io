<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

Conditions such as extreme pressure, water quality, temperature or turbidity can all trigger the assembly to deteriorate in its performance.
