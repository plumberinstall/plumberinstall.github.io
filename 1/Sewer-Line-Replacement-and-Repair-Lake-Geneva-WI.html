The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs record wetness so that it doesn't get in the control unit. Although little pieces of sediment might get through a drip leg.</p>
<p>When used in battling a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firemen by and large are not worried about backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about securing people's lives and to a lesser level their home. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source offered to achieve that objective. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as a result imply that the level of protection on the fire protection system might need to be increased to a high danger defense level.</p>
