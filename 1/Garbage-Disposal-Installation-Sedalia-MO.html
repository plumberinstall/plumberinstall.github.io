Sediment Accumulation: If you see weird popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this could be an indication that sediment has built up in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating aspect. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat.

The field test may not constantly reveal you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair set are necessary.
