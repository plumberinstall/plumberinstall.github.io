<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable solution, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>
