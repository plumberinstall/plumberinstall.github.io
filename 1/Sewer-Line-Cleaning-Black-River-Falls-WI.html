This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
