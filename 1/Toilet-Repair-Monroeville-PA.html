<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company provides consist of check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel designs), and lowered pressure zone assemblies. Suggestion: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, remove the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before installing the disposal. Likewise attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you connect the P-trap.</p>

<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
