<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less critical things that can weaken or break.

You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
