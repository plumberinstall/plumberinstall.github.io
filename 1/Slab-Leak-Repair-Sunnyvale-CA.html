<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Sunnyvale CA</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
