<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had excellent reviews and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>Sinks aren't as easy as they utilized to be. These days, property owners can choose from a dizzying range of sinks for the kitchen, bath, wet bar, utility room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is normally a sign of a blockage in the plumbing system. If the obstruction isn't eliminated, water pressure can build up within the pipe, ultimately causing it to burst.</p>
