<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running home appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the rotting of organic matters like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to prevent off that danger, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to just trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
