<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
