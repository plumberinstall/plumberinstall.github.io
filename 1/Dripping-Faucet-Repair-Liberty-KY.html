<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>

When these parts wear out, they lead to small leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye.
