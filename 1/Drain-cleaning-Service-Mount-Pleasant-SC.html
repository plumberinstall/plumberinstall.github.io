<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
