<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Orange CT</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not pose a risk to the supply of water, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
