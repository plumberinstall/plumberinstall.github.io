<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage smell originating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be a sign of a major problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your home may have burst or otherwise broken. It is necessary that you call a qualified plumber if there is a consistent sewage odor in your home. Raw sewage is extremely harmful and can posture severe health dangers.</p>
<p>A common whole-house repipe can take anywhere from three to 5 days, depending on the size of the house, the number of levels it has and the picked pipe material. Throughout a repipe, plumbers will make strategic cuts in the drywall, completely replace the pipes, re-install the removed drywall and patch it to eliminate any signs of damage or change to your home.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more expensive to repipe because the plumber will need to browse through walls to do the task. Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a big job - and it's a task you wish to get right. But the variety of plumbing pipe materials to choose from can make it confusing. Here we look at a few of the characteristics of the major pipe types to help you pick the right pipe for your plumbing.</p>
