<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult task because of the age of the house and place of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers readily available that you might run into. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check".

Double Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
