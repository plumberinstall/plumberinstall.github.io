Plumbing inspections make sure that water systems in structures are linked properly, without any cross-connection to contaminate drinkable water systems.

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
