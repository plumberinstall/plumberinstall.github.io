<p>The most reliable way to deal with hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. This large amount of garbage does not need to go in the trash bin if it can easily and quickly be gotten rid of through the sink.
