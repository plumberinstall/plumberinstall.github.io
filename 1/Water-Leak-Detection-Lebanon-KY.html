Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water system within a building these devices are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no chance to supply one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
