<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant factor to the hardness of Woodbury's water. Hardness can appear as a problem when water is boiled or dried from a drip because it forms a white powder residue when all the water evaporates. It also interferes with soap and cleaning agent usage. Individuals with very soft water can use smaller sized amounts of soap and cleaning agent for washing.</p>
<p>There are two broad classifications of sources of possible cross contamination: external and internal. Internal sources consist of the aforementioned kitchen sinks, basins, tanks, toilets, fire control system water, water from ice makers, soapy water from sinks or floor cleaning tasks, and appliances such as dish washers, hot water tanks, radiant water heater, and so on. External sources consist of rain water run-off from roofings and parking area, groundwater, puddles of surface area water, hygienic sewer pipelines, other water system pipelines, septic systems, underground tank and cisterns, watering pipelines and ditches, fish ponds, natural bodies of water, sprinkler system, agricultural run-off from animal lots, drainage from compost heap, buried or aboveground chemical storage tanks, gray water from water recycling systems, and backup of combined overflow sewage systems during heavy rains events into structure structures and basements.</p>
