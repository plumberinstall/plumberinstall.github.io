<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed correctly (Image 8). You do not need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Everybody who's installed a few disposals is aware of this error: Forgetting to eliminate the dishwasher knockout prior to hanging the system. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been recently used and you've replaced the flapper, the issue might be bigger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its capability to seal properly, creating waste and a higher water expense.</p>
