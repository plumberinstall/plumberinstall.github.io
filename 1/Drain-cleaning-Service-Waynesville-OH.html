<p>First consider your alternatives if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has started to leak. A complete sewer pipe replacement may not be needed. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better alternative. If your sewer lines are below trees, near comprehensive landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can cause a lot of collateral damage (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>
