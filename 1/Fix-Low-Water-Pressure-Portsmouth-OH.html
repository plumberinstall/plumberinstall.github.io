<p>You reside in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to corrode and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't already have one. This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
