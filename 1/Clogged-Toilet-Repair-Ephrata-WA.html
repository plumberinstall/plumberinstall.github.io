<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink.

I was extremely happy with their service.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.

If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
