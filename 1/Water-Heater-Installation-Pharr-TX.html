<p>Leak detection belongs of water conservation that counts on highly technical expertise and specialized equipment to determine the area of leakages throughout the city's water distribution system and determine the area of those leaks at which noticeable water might or might not have actually emerged.

<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation.

Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
