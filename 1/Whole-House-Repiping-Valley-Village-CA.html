<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet in Valley Village CA 91607</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
