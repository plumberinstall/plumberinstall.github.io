When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can take place.</p>
