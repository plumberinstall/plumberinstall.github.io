<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed.

The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
