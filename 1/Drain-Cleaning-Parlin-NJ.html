<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Parlin NJ</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
