<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger rust that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
