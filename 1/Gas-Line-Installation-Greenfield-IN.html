While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
