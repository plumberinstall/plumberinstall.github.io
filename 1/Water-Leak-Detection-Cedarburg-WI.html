PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of flexibility, which means plumbers can bend the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which conserves money and time and reduces the risk of joint leakages. PEX likewise resists rust and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which product is best depending on your needs.</p>
