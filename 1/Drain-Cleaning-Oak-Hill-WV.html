<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
