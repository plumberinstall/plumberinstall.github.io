<p>Inspect the washer for wear or cracks when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is easy and cheap. But discovering the right washer might not be. The most typical washers are often available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be tough to find. Remove it and take it to the store to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
