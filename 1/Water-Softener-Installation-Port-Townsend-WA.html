Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel eventually experiences deterioration and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
