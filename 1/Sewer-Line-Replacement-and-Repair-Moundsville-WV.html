<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Moundsville WV 26041</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
