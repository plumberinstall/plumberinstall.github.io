<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
