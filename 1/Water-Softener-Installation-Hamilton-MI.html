<p>Backflow Preventers are an essential element of any plumbing task with the function of keeping potable water different from any potential hazards through many different applications. We offer a range of types of Backflow Preventers, including Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) Assemblies, Vacuum Breakers, Dual Checks, and Check Valve Assemblies, in addition to accompanying test valves, sets, and enclosures.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
