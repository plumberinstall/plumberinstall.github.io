<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>
