<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components.

The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
