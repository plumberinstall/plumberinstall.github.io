<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
