<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully since hard water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to use more and more cleaning agent to accomplish the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and decontaminated during regeneration. Lastly, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
