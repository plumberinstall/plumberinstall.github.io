<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Lorton VA</h3>
<p>The most effective method to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a residence is due to the fact that there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are pretty cheap and easy to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease strengthens it adheres to the pipe and prevents water circulation, ultimately causing a backup. This added with other debris in your drain can trigger a major backup.</p>
