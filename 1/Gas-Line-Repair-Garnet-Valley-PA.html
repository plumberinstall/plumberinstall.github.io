All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate type of assembly based upon the conditions on your property (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly must satisfy the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be terminated until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
