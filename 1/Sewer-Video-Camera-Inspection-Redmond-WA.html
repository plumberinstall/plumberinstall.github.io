<h3>Leak Detection in Redmond Washington</h2>
<p>As soon as the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage turned off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly.
