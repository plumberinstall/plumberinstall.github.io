<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The professional shut off the water supply and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture.

Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with an inferior plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
