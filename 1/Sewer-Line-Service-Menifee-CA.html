<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
