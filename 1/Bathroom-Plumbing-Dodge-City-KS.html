<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, including poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, particularly in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation.
