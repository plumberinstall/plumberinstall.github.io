<p>Never ever stress over concealed costs or surprise charges with Plumb Perfect Plumbing! We offer affordable flat-rate rates on all our services. The house still had lead pipes. Homes integrated in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes might leach into the drinking water, not to mention the health risks connected with lead.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>As the solidity in the water increases, so does the annual savings. In a 40-gpg hard water market, salt cost savings alone can reach $1,144 each year. A lot of water looks alike - nevertheless inside a clear glass of water there thousands of dissolved minerals which are completely unnoticeable to your naked eye. One glass of faucet water can have a high content of minerals - another glass of faucet water can have a low content of minerals.</p>
