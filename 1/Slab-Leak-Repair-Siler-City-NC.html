An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure includes coating Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leaks and corrosion within the line.

<p>The sewer camera inspection enables you to actually see the interior condition of the drain line. It also lets you see the product the drain line is made from. You can tell if the problem with your drain line is in a particular location, or if the entire line or a portion of the sewer line needs replacing. If there is a break in the line, the camera not only validates the place of the break however enables you to see the nature of the break, as well.

<h3>Hydro Scrub Jetting in Siler City North Carolina</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
