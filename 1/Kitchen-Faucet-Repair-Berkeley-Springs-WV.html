Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly.
