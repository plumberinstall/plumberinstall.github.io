When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
