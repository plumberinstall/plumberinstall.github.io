<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
