It is hardly ever used today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings.

Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regrow after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
