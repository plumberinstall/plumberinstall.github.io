<h3>Frozen Pipes in Lancaster Massachusetts</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>

Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is a lot more reliable at eliminating obstructions. Numerous houses have drain cleanouts, however, we come across older homes without cleanouts. If you are having drain problems, a professional plumber can add cleanouts to your house.</p>
