<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a couple of things worth knowing about waste disposal unit installation. You depend on your hot water heater every day for all the hot water you and your family need to cook, clean, and bathe.

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair specialist knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
