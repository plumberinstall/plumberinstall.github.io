Electric ranges are also much easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>

The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
