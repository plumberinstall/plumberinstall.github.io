<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
