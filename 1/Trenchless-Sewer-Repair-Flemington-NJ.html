<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
