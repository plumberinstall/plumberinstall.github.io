<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
<p>If you have actually split or broken drains up until a video inspection is carried out, it's hard to determine. Cracked or broken drains are typically preceded by recurring blockages, consistent foul drain smells or the presence of sewer flies. The first step is effort to clear the blocked drain and after that immediately examine the drain. In many cases a smoke test can be carried out to reveal breaks or fractures. ZOOM DRAIN carries out a free peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
