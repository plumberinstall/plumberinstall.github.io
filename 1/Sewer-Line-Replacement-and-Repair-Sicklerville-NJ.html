Like any house appliance, a toilet tank includes many small moving parts that may need changed with use with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and cause toilet leakages that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
