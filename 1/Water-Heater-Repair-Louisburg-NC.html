<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Louisburg NC</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
