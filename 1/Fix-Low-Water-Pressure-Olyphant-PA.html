Like any machine, a sink has multiple parts that need maintenance and repair over time.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
