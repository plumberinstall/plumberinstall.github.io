<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both.
