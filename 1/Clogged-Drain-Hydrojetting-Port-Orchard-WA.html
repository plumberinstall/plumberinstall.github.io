<p>Once the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
