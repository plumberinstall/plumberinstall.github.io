<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
