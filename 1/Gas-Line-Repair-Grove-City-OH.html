<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>A range of pipe materials are used for whole home repiping, including PEX and copper pipe. The cost varies, depending on the type of product and size of your home.
