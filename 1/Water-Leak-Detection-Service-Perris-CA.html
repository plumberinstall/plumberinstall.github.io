<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made from aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would generally trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will eventually end up being worn out and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you might experience significant problems with your hot water heater extremely quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
