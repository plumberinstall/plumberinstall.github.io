<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
