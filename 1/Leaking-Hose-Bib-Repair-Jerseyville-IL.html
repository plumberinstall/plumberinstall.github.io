<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly.

It's an easy repair, however there's a technique to getting the flush manage out. The maintaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Picture 1). Then get rid of the old manage and lever, slide the new handle into place, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten by relying on the right (Photo 2).</p>
