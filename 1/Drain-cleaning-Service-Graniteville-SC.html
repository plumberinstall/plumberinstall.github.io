<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To avoid this, make certain the new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>

<p>To determine if your home is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water pipe are usually blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main turned off is attached to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, the majority of drain concerns can just be found once they begin to back up. But, during routing plumbing inspections, a full test of all drains will be performed. If something may be taking place behind the walls or in the ground, plumbers can try to recreate problems to identify. Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is a lot more efficient at eliminating obstructions. Many houses have drain cleanouts, however, we encounter older homes without cleanouts. If you are having drain problems, a professional plumber can include cleanouts to your home.</p>
