This causes the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are accessible, leading to the strange sounds emanating from your sink.</p>

Many scattering systems currently have the appropriate backflow preventer set up and need only be checked every year. Others might not fulfill state and local policies and might need to be changed with the correct backflow preventer.</p>
