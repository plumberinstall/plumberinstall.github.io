<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

<p>If you notice low water pressure or stained water, it usually signifies rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop over time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might notice lower water pressure. The discoloration occurs when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health hazard in your water.</p>
