<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners wish to get their hands dirty with. It needs more than just elbow grease to fix broken sewer systems, and the problem is typically due to how problematic it is to assess the damage. This is even more problematic if the damage is irreparable or requires more substantial repair, specifically in commercial settings.</p>
