<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
