<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Irvington AL</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
