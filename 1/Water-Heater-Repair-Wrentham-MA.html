If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
