<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair service technician knows the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
