<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and removes from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
