<p>The most efficient way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
