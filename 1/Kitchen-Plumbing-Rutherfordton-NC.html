<p>A guideline is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself.
