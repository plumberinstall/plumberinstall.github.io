<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
