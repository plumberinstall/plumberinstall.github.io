When a customer calls you with a plumbing emergency, you need assistance from a company who comprehends your market. See what makes Ferguson the trusted plumbing provider for trade experts.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when used in combating a fire. Firefighters by and large are not interested in backflow prevention problems.

Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source available to attain that goal. This can produce cross-connection control problems and might as a result imply that the level of security on the fire defense system may need to be increased to a high threat security level.</p>
