Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to discover.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a relatively simple system, regardless of their value.

From here, the preventer can monitor the movement of water within your system, and prevent any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be caused by malfunctioning plumbing devices. This guarantees that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems stays detached from clean" water.</p>
