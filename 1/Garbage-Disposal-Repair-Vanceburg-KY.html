<p>When selecting, request evidence of a license. Most states require plumbers to be licensed, and they normally provide a number you can call to confirm that the license is present and that there are no active problems versus it. Any plumber you think about must also hold an existing employees' payment policy and a minimum of $500,000 liability insurance coverage.</p>
