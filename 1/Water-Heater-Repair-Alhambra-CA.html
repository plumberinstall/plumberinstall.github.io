Examining the water meter is a fantastic next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine.

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public water supply and personal on-site water system and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections between potable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of main and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow approaches offer an increased level of security for the public water system system.</p>
