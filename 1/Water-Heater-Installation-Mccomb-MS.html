<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
