<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Hampton Bays NY</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually maintained at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Because of the inherent design of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an extremely low flow or fixed flow condition may trigger annoyance leaking and potential fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
