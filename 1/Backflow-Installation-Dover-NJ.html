<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Dover NJ</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
