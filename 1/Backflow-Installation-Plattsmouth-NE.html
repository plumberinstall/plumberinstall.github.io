Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
