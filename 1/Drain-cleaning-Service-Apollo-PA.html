<p>You live in an older home. There's an excellent chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old.

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable option, especially when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
