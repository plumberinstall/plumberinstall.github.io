<p>Some producers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
