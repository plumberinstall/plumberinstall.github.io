<p>Most softeners have actually a bypass constructed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to supply some type of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's wise to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the system.</p>
<p>Water softeners will go to drain throughout backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the unit). Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of solidity minerals and chloride that you may not desire simply running outside.
