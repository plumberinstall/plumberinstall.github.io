<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel eventually experiences corrosion and does not have the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
