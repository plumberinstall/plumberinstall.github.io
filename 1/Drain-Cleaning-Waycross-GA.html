At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
