<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
