Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

These systems normally are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
