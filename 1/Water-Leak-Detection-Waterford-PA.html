<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Waterford PA</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
