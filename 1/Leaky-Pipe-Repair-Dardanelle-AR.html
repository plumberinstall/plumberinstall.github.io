<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive Dardanelle AR</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
