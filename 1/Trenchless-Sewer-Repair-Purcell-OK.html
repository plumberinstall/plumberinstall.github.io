<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>The majority of softeners have actually a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to offer some type of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to maintain the unit.</p>
