A toilet's tank is made up of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their frequent use. When these parts wear, they lead to small leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
