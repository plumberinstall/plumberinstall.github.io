<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation.

<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by straightening it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Plumbers install and repair water, gas, and other piping systems in factories, houses, and services. They install plumbing components, such as tubs and toilets, and home appliances, such as dishwashers and hot water heater. They clean drains, get rid of obstructions, and repair or replace broken pipes and components. Plumbers likewise help maintain septic systems-- big, underground holding tanks that collect waste from homes that are not connected to a sewer system.</p>
<p>If you need aid with your plumbing pipes, call 800-483-0784 to request service.
