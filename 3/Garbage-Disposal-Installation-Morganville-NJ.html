<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up throughout building and construction of a brand-new or renovated structure is installed by educated craftsmen in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you normally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.
