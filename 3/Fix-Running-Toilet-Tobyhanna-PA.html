These correspond directly to how much waste the unit can handle, and suggested sizes are usually based upon how many users remain in a household. If your existing disposal blockages typically, is loud, leakages or does not operate properly, it may be time for a replacement. Installations need to only be performed by plumbers as the installation needs both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>

Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger obstructions and jams - consider composting or putting these items in the garbage.
