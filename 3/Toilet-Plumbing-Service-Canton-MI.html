<p>These branching distribution pipelines form networks and loops consisting of water pipe and supply pipelines. Water pipe vary in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in diameter. The pipelines offer water for entire areas along with big commercial, industrial and residential complexes. Depending on the circulation capability, area and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a range of materials: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter strengthened concrete.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, generally sodium. Sodium won't trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only a very small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered really low sodium" by the Fda.</p>
