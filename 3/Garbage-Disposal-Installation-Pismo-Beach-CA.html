<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
