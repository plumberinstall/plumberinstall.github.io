<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
