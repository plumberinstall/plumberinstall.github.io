<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
