<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will establish.

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
