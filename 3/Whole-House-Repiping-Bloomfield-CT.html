<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
