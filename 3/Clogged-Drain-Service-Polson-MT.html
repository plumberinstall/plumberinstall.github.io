<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
