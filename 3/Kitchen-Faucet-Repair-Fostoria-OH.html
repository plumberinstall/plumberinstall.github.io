Water softeners typically utilize sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from liquified salt chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the accumulation could still occur.</p>
