<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
