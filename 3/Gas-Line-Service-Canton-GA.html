<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear.

Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed of galvanized metals.</p>
