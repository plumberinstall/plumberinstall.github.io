<p>Before the repair service technician starts the repair process, he needs to make certain he has examined the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any limiting conditions. Appropriate security preventative measures should be followed for proper entry if the area is considered a confined area. A safe and correct workplace may require the positioning of security barricades or entry limitations around the work area so the repair professional or the public around your work area are not damaged. If the backflow preventer is installed in a restrictive area, this might impact the service technician's ability to effectively finish the repair.</p>
