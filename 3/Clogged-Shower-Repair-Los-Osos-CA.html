<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more prone and breakable to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure.

<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an important part of your home or company, and its capability to function is necessary. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this might be a sign of a bigger problem, like a tree root invasion or a big clog. If the drains clog sometimes however you can usually flush them out, this may be a smaller sized clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Little obstructions can turn into huge ones fairly rapidly.</p>
