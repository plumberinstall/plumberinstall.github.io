<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream might cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
