<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist understands the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
