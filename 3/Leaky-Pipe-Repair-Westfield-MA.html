<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
