<h3>Reverse Osmosis Installation in Saltillo Mississippi</h2>
<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
