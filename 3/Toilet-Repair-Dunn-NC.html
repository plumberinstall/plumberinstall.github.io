<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely removes hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>CALL Nicor Gas at 888. Nicor4U (888.642.6748) and emergency responders at 911 once you remain in a safe place, far from the area of the suspected leak.
