<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the culprit. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>If your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a blockage, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go on and replace the whole line. If the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout, absolutely replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate alternative to do simply that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be an option.</p>
