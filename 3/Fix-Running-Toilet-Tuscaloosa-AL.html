<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complex than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this may be something to consider. A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must. When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to link wires properly, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
