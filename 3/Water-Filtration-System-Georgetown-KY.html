<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
