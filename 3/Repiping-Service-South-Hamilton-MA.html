<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but seldom stop to consider. Energy Performance. Picking a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star score is recommended. The energy efficiency of a storage water heater is shown by its Energy Aspect (EF). The more efficient the hot water heater the greater the EF ranking.

<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
