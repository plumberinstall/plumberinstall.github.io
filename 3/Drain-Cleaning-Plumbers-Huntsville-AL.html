<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
<p>Other than for domestic pump and pump and irrigation systems, certification is not needed to install plumbing systems outside of a building (e.g., water lines connected directly to municipal water pipe, sewer line connections, and so on).

The installation needs to be assessed to ensure it does not circumvent the workings of the assembly. Test data must be built up to figure out the functions of each element. The backflow prevention assembly must be dismantled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be tested once again to be sure it was properly fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the producers flowchart is necessary to ensure it was fixed properly. An appropriately fixed assembly needs to supply years of security.</p>
