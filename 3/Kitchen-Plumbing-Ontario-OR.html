<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating supplies a range of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can cause considerable problems and damage-- specifically common in older houses. Using a sewer camera to inspect the weak areas or clog, our extremely trained professionals can quickly find the source of the problem keeping your sewer line from doing its task-- effectively transferring wastewater to your sewage-disposal tank or community system.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
