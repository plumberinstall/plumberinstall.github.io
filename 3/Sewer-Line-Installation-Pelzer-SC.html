<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can.

By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent out to land fills and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
