<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
