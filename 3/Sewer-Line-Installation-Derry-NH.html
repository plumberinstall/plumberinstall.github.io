<p>There are various causes for obstructions depending upon where they take place in your plumbing Toilets clog from excessive toilet tissue for the most part. When the toilet paper gathers in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet instead of flowing through it, the toilet will not flush. The water just back up in the bowl. When our plumber has to get rid of the toilet to unclog the drain correctly, there are times.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you very first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the proper safety measures.</p>
