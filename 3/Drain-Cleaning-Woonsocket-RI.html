<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
