<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible amount, there need to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
