<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Port Arthur TX</h3>
<p>All of us experience a clogged drain at some time. You can try to take matters into your hands by utilizing daily products, such as a plunger, a coat hanger, or a snake. Some property owners will attempt to remove the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These remedies do work, especially if you are handling a small drain clog. However, they are usually short-term repairs that do not use permanent resolutions.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the problem if this is the case. You may need to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. There are 2 standard piping products used by plumbing experts.
