<p>Inside the house, inspect the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for drips or leakages. Examine beneath sinks to look for leaking pipes. Local plumber estimated price of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I checked around. Under the sink, put a bucket or pan below the drain, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
