<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.
