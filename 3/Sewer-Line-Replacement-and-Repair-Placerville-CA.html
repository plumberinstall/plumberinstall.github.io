<p>The Minor Label Program is an alternative inspection program established by the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS). The program makes use of minor installation labels and random inspections instead of routine electrical and plumbing permits for certain types of small electrical and plumbing work.

<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is an abrupt reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as throughout fire combating or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This reversal can develop a suction impact and draw possible pollutants into the safe and clean (drinking) water supply.
