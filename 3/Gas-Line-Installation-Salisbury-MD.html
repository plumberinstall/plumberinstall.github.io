<p>When seeking a gas line installation in Dallas, therefore, you need to use well-trained and certified professionals for all aspects of your plumbing and gas line installation. Once your plumber has actually installed a gas line, you'll desire an audit of the plumbing and installation to ensure that there are no gas leakages. This must be done prior to the plumber leaves the job. The audit will minimize the opportunities of a gas leak. Shut off the gas valves immediately if you do observe a pungent odor in your house after your plumber leaves. Leave the structure and make sure that open fire does not get close to your home till a professional can fix the gas leak. Contact your gas utility company immediately.</p>
