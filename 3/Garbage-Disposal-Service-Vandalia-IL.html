<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
