<p>You can unwind and utilize your gas piping without any worry when we handle your gas or propane pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's likewise an issue for the environment.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
