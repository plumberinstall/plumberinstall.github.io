When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high threat protection assembly.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
