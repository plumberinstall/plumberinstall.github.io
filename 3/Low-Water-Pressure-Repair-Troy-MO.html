<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for the majority of building contractors (or their employees). The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
