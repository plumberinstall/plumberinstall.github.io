<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Rochester PA 15074</h3>
<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your sink, shower or tub. With time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials gather in the drain and eventually harden against the pipe walls, making them tough to get rid of.

The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health threat in your water.</p>
