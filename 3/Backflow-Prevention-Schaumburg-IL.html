<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by correcting it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some clogs.

<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
