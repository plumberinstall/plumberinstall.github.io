<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided superb service for us in changing a very balky tub spout, and broken toilet parts. Not only was he comprehensive and extremely professional however he had the ability to answer all my concerns worrying the service. I would give 6 stars if I could. A camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most efficient methods of finding the exact location of a plumbing issue. A plumber will insert a specially created waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live footage to identify where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
