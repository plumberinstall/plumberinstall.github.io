<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for performing yearly forward flow tests are often perceived as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to only attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
<p>Idea: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and check the flange and drain for leakages. Backflow - Do you discover water reappearing in your sink or shower?
