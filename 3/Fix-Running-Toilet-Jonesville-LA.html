<p>When the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
