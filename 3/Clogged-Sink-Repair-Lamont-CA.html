<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
