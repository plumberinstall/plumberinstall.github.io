<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Guilford CT</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
