If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
