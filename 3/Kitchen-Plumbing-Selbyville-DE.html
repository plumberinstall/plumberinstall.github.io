Dripping water is typically triggered by problems in the pressure-relief valve. If there are leaks originating from the warm water tank, possibilities are the storage is currently corroded. If your tank is relatively brand-new and you have this problem, check for dents and holes. Assess your backyard for any invasive tree roots.
