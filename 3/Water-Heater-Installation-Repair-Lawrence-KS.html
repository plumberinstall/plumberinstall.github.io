The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
