<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>One common way for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue could spread exponentially. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private residences, it likewise avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and contaminating the public supply of water.</p>
