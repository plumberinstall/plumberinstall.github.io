<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can create major drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the concern for regular house plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it results in additional damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
