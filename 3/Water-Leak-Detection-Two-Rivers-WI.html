<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the most basic of the three readily available methods. Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and require less repairs over time. Sanford & Boy plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations.
