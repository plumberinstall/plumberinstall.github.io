<p>Long-term magnetic water conditioning devices have been marketed based on a range of claims regarding their impact on water firmness and associated scale formation. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has not been able to determine requirements for these products and report inconsistent performance to date.

<p>If you presume your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it doesn't necessarily require a repair of your whole unit. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>There are 2 main kinds of backflow systems: air gap (AG) and minimized pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's estimated that everyone uses around 80-100 gallons of water a day. That's a great deal of water. In reality, it's a quantity that can send out a flood of dollars out of your wallet if you're depending on a outdated or broken  water heater.</p>
