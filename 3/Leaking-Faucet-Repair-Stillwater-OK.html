<p>If you presume your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it doesn't necessarily require a repair of your whole unit. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
