<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>

<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
