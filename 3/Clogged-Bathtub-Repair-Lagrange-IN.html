At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
