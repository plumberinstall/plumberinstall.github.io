Our makers run by snaking a rotating cable television with a connected blade through your pipes. The blades will dislodge the accumulation due to grease, soap, tree roots, and other foreign objects.

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
