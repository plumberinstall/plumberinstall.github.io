When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

You may be thinking that it does not make good sense to use a pipe that reacts with water as your home's main source of water transport, and you would be appropriate.

<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
