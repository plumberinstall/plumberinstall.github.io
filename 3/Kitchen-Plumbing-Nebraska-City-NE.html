Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
