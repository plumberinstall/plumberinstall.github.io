<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 utilised to get rid of wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk contains the earliest recognized examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had exchangeable and easily detachable sectors, and enabled cleaning.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; additional, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for homeowners. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
