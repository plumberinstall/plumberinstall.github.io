<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber San Tan Valley AZ</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, usually sodium. Salt will not cause lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only a very percentage of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is thought about extremely low sodium" by the Fda.</p>
