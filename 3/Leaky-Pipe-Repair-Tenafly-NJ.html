<p>Our plumber teams aim to keep your house and work locations efficient, functional and comfy. When it rains, any excess water is supposed to go down a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems.

If a clogged storm drain is not attended to in a prompt manner, the possibilities are high that it will cause extra damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there need to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you ought to probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
