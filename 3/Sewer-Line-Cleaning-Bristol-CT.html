Waste disposal unit are quite simple to keep. The most important thing to bear in mind is that they are truly food disposals.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be annoying. The twist-and-drop design is a lot easier to utilize but requires occasional -ring replacement.</p>
