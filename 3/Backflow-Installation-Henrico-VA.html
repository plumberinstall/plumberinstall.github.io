<p>When the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
