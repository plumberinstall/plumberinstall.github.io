<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
