<h3>How To Choose An Exceptional Plumbing Service Cerritos CA</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
