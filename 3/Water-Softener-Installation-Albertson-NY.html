<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
