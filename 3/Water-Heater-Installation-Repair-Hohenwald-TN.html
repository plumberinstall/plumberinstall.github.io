<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are particular contaminants that homeowners are dealing with and an RO can assist relieve those issues. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste.

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
