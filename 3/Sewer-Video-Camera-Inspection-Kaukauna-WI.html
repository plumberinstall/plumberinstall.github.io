<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you may run into. The first is a check valve. The second is a double check".

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
