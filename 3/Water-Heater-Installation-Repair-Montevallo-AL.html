<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the concern.
