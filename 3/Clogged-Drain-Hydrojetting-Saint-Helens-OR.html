<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there must be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you should probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
