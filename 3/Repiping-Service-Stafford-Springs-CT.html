<p>Inspect the home's warm water heater You will be aiming to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of 4 ought to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated up and offered for usage. Also, rust of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. Request that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of corrosion.</p>
