Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>

Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
