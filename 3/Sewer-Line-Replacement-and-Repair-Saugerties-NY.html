The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the watering line within your organisation, where irrigation fulfills the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can keep track of the movement of water within your system, and avoid any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing devices.

When you attach the P-trap, also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
<p>Since 1980, backflow preventers have been lawfully mandated for specific structures by the New York Sanitary Code and the Rules of the City of New York.

Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow.
