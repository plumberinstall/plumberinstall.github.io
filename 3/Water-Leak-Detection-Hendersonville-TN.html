<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to save money. While this may operate in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same material as other pipes in your home, implying that problem might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you peace of mind and prevent bigger leaks down the road.</p>
