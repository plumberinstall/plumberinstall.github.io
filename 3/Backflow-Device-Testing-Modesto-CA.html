<p>To identify if your house is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it enters the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is connected to completion of the water main. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
