When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you usually understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Blockages in a fixture can cause destructive damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>

A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
