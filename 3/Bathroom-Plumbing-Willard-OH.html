<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
