<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
