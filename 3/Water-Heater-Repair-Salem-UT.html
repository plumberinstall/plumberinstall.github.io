<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractor in Salem</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective working a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I've contacted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
