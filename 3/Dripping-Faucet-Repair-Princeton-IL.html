<p>A. If you have rust areas, utilizing phosphoric acid usually will help remove them. If you wish to attempt the gentlest technique perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
