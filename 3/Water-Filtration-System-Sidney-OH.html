<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Drains clog for a reason, but it's not always obvious. It is strongly suggested that a professional plumber perform a camera inspection on a main sewer line after it has clogged. If you're buying a home, this is doubly essential. Imagine in the above circumstance knowing the condition of the line prior to the purchase of a house. You can't always be particular whether the home has actually had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous house owner understood the factor for the clog A simple camera inspection might make you familiar with a covert and extremely pricey  issue prior to the purchase.</p>
