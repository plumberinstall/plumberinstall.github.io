<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Saint Johns MI 48879</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than products containing severe chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
