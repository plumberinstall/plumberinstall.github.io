<p>Examine the house's hot water heater You will be aiming to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be warmed and readily available for use. Also, rust of the tank's components can trigger the tank to have a brief life. Demand that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of corrosion.</p>
