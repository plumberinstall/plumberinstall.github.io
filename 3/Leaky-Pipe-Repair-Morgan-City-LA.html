Sounds good, doesn't it? What if we told you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environmentally friendly water systems for houses, you can.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
