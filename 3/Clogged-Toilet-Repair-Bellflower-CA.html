<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and inspect the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you see water coming back in your sink or shower? This could indicate that the water does not have a clear course to do through, more than likely due to the fact that of a blocked drain. This is also the very best time to include the cable and plug to your disposal. It's truly awkward to add these after you have finished this how to install a garbage disposal task.</p>
