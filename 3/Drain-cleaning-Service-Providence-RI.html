<p>If you have a septic tank, then you might erroneously believe that you can not have a garbage disposal, and this is not true. Nevertheless, house owners with garbage disposals and septic tanks may have to pump their septic more often. The plumber you employ to install the unit also impacts the total rate for a new garbage disposal. The MDH also advises NOT softening the cold water supply to your kitchen faucet or your outside hose connections. This will significantly decrease the quantity of salt in your diet plan and conserve you money by not softening water needlessly.</p>
