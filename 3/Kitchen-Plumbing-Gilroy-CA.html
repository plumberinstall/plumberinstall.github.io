Hard water hinders the lathering of shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Difficult water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
