<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
