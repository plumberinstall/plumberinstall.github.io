<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
