Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
