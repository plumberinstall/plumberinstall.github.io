<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
