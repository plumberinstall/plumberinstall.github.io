<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and obligation are extremely important to developing a reputation for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water system within a structure these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, but steel eventually struggles with deterioration and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
