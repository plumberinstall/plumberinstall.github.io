<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer needs lots of items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be assessed. The installation needs to be examined to guarantee it does not circumvent the workings of the assembly. Test data must be accumulated to identify the workings of each element. The backflow prevention assembly should be dismantled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be tested once again to be sure it was appropriately repaired.
