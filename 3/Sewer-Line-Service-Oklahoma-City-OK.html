<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening.

Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
