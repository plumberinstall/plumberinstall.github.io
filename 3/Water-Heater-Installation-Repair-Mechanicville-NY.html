<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it also.</p>
