<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service King George VA</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it also.</p>
