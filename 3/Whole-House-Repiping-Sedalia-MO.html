<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regrow after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
