<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to clogs that originate inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, likewise known as tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The kind of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will determine the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>The electrical and plumbing work associated with waste disposal unit installation make the task potentially dangerous. That makes it a great reason to hire a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. Homeowners can either purchase the new disposal themselves and supply it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the total cost.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or irreversible connection between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>

Another risk in sewer repair projects is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig website. Your security and health are too essential to run the risk of in a Do It Yourself sewer task! Prevent these safety threats by working with a professional plumber.</p>
