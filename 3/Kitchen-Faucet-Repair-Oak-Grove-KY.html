<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
