A license, in addition to the required health and safety inspections, are needed for all new and replacement plumbing setups. The replacement of existing plumbing fixtures also needs a license and subsequent inspections.</p>

Undesirable situations and unexpected events might take place anytime and being unprepared can put your business in huge financial trouble. To be safe instead of sorry, getting the right insurance for your plumbing company functions as a defense against monetary risks and organisation jeopardies.</p>
