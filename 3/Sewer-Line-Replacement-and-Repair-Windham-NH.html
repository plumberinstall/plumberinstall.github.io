When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical service, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
