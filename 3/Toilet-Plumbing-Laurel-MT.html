<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions except directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the appliance. Each place where you will have a gas device need to have a gas shutoff valve.
