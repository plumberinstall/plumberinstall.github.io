<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible solution, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
