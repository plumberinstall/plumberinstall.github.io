<p>Unusual Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to travel through. The pipes typically make weird gurgling noises as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe due to the fact that of the tight space. This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the unusual noises emanating from your sink.</p>
