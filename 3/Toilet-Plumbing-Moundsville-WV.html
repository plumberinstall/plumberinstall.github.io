<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
