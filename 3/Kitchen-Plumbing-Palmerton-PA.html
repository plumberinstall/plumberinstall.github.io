<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
