<p>It's an oddly complicated scientific process, however simple to treat. It uses salt to eliminate odors and minerals discovered in hard water- most typically calcium and magnesium.

<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas.

Assemblies not presently noted should have been listed at the time of the original installation.</p>

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
