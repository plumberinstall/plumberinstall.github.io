Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
