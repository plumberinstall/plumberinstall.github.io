<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
