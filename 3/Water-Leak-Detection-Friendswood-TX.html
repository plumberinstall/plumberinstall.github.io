Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
