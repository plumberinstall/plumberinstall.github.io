<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
