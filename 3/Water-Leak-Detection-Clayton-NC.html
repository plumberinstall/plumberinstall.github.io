<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are severely damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>

<p>While pipe lining is a fantastic alternative for the majority of people, there are some circumstances where repiping is the only choice. Repiping is the process of changing old corroded pipes with resilient and lasting new pipes. The new pipes that are used are generally made of copper since of their toughness and other aspects. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
