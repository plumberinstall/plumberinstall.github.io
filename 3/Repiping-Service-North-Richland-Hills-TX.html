The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck.

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit ought to not leak. It usually shows wear and tear which is a reasonable indication that its time is up when this takes place.
