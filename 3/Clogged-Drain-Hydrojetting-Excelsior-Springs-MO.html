<p>Water might be leaking onto the pilot burner flame. A leaking tank is a factor to call a water heater specialist instantly.

<h3>Plumbing Video Camera Inspection in Excelsior Springs Missouri</h2>
<p>A guideline is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a new burner set and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
