<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable expenses can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for homeowners.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally restore after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
