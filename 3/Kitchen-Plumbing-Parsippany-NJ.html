<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made from aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would typically trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will eventually become worn out and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you could experience significant problems with your hot water heater really quickly, not to point out finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Authorization and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger water pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the home, enabling it to stream backward into city water products.</p>
