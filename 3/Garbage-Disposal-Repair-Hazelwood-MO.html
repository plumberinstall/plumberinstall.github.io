<p>To figure out if your house is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it gets in the house near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is connected to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, however if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. You may need to change toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is relatively new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing info. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next step would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail beneath the area to capture water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
