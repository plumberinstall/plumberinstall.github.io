<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you need to first obtain the needed permit( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our Permit page to find out more on obtaining an authorization. As soon as you get a license you can start with the work. Nevertheless, you need to require inspection before you cover or conceal any work.</p>
