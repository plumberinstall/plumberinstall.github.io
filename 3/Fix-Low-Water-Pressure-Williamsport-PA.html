<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the drinkable system offering the make-up water, backpressure is created. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Potential impurities can then go into the potable water supply.

In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>

However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they accumulation on contact surfaces, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of soaps and cleaning agents. At this point the water is stated to be hard.</p>
