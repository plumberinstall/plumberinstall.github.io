<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician turned off the water system and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The consumer assisted our service technician in moving the toilet back into its appropriate area, and the technician tightened the bolts prior to restoring the water supply and guaranteeing that the toilet was properly flushing.</p>
<p>Add more hot water if it slowly recedes as you work. Keep plunging until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to attempt a new approach.
