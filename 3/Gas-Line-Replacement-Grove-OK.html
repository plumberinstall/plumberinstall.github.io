<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>It's a great concept to schedule annual inspections if your plumbing system is decades old and if you know that you have a history of clogging or leaking. Test.
