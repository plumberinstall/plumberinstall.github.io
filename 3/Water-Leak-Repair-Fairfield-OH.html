<p>A weird gurgling sound when your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never ever a great sign. Don't depend on a plunger to correct the concern-- depend on your plumber for sewer line repair.

Many fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Usually, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Despite the operating system, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
