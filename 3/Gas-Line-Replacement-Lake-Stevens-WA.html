<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water passing through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>Utilize the convenient self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several homes in my neighborhood being repiped and have actually spoken to neighbors about the problems leading up to this.
