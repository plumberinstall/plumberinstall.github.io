<p>Backflow is bad news. The prevention of backflow contaminants into drinkable water supply is crucialÂ not just in commercial and industrial applications, but likewise in residential systems.

<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
