<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and responsibility are exceptionally important to developing a credibility for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean supply of water within a building these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
