<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without solidity ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
