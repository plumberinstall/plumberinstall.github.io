<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Tipton IN</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually maintained at a considerable pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
