<p>Many toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not require repairing the entire toilet. Like any home device, a toilet tank includes many small moving parts that might need changed with use with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and trigger toilet leaks that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can likewise take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
