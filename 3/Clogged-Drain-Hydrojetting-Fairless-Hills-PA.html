<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated option of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

If you're converting your house to natural gas, or if the existing line is at capacity, expect to invest $2,000 or more. Brand-new gas line expenses include home appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
