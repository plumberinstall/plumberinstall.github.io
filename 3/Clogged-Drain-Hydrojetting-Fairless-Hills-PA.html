The brine tank holds a highly concentrated option of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
