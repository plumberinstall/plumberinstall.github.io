<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. If the water turns off, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm.
