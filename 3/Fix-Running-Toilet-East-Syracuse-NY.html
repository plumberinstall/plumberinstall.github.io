Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water system within a building these gadgets are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
