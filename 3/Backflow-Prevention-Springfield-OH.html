<p>Once the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>

Loud or loud plumbing can indicate that a pipe replacement may be needed, especially if the noises are caused by low or high-pressure variations.
