Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
