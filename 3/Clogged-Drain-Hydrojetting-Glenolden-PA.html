<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable option, particularly when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
