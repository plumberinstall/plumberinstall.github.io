Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
