<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Mission Viejo CA 92691</h3>
<p>Aside from these 2 important elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less crucial things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
