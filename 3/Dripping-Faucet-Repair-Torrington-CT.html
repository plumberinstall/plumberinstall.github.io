<p>If you've always lived in an area with tough water, you might not understand just how much it impacts you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from tough water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Difficult water likewise makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red frequently.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal system to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then link it. Relying on the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Some homeowners may think of water softeners as a high-end item, something that's good to have" but not entirely needed. However, hard water can cause everything from small inconveniences, like spots on meals or soap scum, to significant problems like a shorter life expectancy for your water heater, dishwasher, and other essential home devices. For these factors and others, a water softener can be a helpful financial investment for your house.</p>
