<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you should most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
