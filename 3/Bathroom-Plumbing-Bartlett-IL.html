Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Inhaling leaked gas in an indoor space, such as your home can result in an absence of oxygen in the air and result in hypoxia.
