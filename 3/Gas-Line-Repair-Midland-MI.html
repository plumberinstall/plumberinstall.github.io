The brine tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
