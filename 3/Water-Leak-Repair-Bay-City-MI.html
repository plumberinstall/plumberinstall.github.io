<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would usually trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately become worn out and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience significant problems with your hot water heater extremely rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Gently lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed correctly (Image 8). You do not have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
