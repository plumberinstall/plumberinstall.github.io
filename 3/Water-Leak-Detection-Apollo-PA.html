<p>Damage control is a concern. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I encounter circumstances, on a regular basis that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. In some cases, the basements are so loaded with sewage, I can not securely operate and get in the basement up until the sewage is drawn out and the basement is generally cleaned. I 'd enjoy to publish some pictures of this. Just search line. The problem does exist.</p>
