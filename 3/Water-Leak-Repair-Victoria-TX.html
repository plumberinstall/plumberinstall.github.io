The clearing of blockages in component branches; the repairing of incidental leaks in valves, fixtures or pipes; or the removal and reinstallation of existing or new plumbing fixtures, residential type plumbing appliances, non-testable backflow gadgets, and plumbing appurtenances; offered that such repairs do not require the replacement or involve of hidden piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or fixtures.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas.

<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or momentary connection in between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's potable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
