<p>Check the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated and offered for usage. Likewise, rust of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see obvious signs of rust, demand that a brand-new one be installed.</p>
