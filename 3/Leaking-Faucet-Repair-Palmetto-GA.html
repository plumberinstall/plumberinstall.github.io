Boilermakers and pipefitters are not plumbers although they deal with piping as part of their trade and their work can include some plumbing.

<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there should be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you must probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop obstructing is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
