By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to supply some sort of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to preserve the system.</p>

<p>To figure out if your house is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water pipe are normally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it gets in the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to completion of the water pipe.
