<p>Property owners often ask if a gas hot water heater or an electric system is more cost-efficient. The response depends upon your home. While gas models are cheaper to operate, they do need an existing natural gas line. The price of an electric hot water heater is generally lower, but it can be more costly to operate. Electric varieties are likewise simpler to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company offers include double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel models), and lowered pressure zone assemblies. Tip: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, eliminate the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before mounting the disposal. Also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you connect the P-trap.</p>
