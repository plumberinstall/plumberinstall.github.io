<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
