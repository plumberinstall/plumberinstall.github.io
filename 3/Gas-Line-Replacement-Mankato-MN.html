<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
