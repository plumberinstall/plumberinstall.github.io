<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
