It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
