<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Your storm drains don't go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually carried somewhere else to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in.

If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted effectively (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
