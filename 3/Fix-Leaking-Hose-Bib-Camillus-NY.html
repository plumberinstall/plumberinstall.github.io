<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Camillus NY 13031</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
