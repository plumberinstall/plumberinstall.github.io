<p>Experienced drain cleaning company in South Plainfield. A new sink can dramatically affect the look of a room.

<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
