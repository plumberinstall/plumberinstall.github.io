<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
