<p>This is one of the very first and main concerns that you should ask yourself when it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your home. The age of your house is an important component to understand whether or not you must repipe your house. This is not just due to the fact that your plumbing has actually aged with time, but also due to the fact that houses that were constructed before a specific time period are more likely to contain galvanized steel, understood to be a metal that is out-of-date in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your house was developed before the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your house may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimal rates if your home was developed decades before that.</p>

All gas piping setups require a license and inspection.</p>
