<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with recognized backflow gadgets on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs.

<p>One typical way for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the problem could spread out significantly. A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in private residences, it also avoids wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and polluting the public supply of water.</p>
