<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Whether you have a waste disposal unit and it's not working properly, or if it's finally time to install one in your home, a garbage disposal is a former luxury that is almost a requirement in these times. Constantly continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has actually disappeared down the drain.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a container underneath the area to catch water then unscrew the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
