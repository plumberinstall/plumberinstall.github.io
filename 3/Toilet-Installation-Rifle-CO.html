<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to supply decades of security. There are lots of local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.

If your set only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair service technician knows the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
