<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Kearny NJ</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely unusual cases where the building is considered to not pose a risk to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>Our backflow preventer choice consists of hose connection vacuum breakers, climatic vacuum breakers, dual check valves and vented double check valves. Each backflow preventer is tested for effectiveness and performance before leaving our Cullman, Alabama factory. This dedication to quality has made us among the most trusted names in the industry.</p>
