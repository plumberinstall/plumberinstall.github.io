Read on to learn about our repiping discounts, in addition to the leading signs you may see if your house or organisation is due for a pipe replacement.</p>
<p>The most typical approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, usually sodium. Sodium won't trigger lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds only an extremely small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about very low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
