<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up throughout construction of a brand-new or renovated building is installed by experienced artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains.

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job.
