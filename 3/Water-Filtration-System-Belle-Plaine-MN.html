<p>The most typical method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, normally salt. Salt won't trigger lime scale or soap scum accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes only an extremely small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about extremely low salt" by the Fda.</p>

At Hall's Plumbing, we work with Forest, CA property owners whenever they need repiping service or pipe repair.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.
