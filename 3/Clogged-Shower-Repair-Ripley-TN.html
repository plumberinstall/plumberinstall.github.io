<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on safety within a structure. Plumbing inspections make sure that water supply in structures are linked effectively, with no cross-connection to contaminate potable water systems.

Hot water heaters are also inspected to make sure that they have been set up effectively, to avoid an explosion.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
