<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firemen by and large are not worried about backflow prevention problems. They are interesting in securing people's lives and to a lesser degree their residential or commercial property. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source available to attain that objective. This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as a result indicate that the level of security on the fire protection system might need to be increased to a high risk defense level.</p>
