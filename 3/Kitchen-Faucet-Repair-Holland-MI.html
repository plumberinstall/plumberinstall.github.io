<h3>Leaking Pipe Repair in Holland Michigan</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
