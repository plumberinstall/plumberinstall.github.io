These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
