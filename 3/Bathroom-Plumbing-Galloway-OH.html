<p>Family operated and owned since 2003, RT Plumbing Services provides industry-leading plumbing know-how, house renovating service, and hot water heater conversions and replacements to the greater Fort Worth, TX community. It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively operating RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be offered.</p>
