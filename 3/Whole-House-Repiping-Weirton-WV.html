<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid normally will help eliminate them. , if you would like to try the gentlest technique perhaps try using some Coke on the rust first.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the instructions and security cautions first!), if that doesn't do the trick. Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to get rid of rust stains and it's readily available at a lot of hardware shops.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company offers include double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel models), and reduced pressure zone assemblies.

Also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
