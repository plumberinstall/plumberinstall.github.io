<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
