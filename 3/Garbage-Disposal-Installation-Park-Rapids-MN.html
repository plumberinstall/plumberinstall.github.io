<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Park Rapids MN</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
