These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
