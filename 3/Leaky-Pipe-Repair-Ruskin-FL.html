<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your shower, sink or tub. Over time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them tough to get rid of.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
