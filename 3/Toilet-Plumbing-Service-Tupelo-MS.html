It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
