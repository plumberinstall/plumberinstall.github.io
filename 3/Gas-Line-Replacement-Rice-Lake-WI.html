<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
