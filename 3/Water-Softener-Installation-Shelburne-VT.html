<p>If you suspect your toilet has a leak, fortunately is that it does not always need a repair of your whole system. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear out, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can likewise cause flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
