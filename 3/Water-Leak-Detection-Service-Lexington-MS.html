<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements.

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals.
