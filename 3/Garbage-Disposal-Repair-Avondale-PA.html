<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank.
