The water is continuously warmed as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is right away switched off, the water stops being heated.

This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the decaying of raw materials like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the functions that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that risk, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking.
