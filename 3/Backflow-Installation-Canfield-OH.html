<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a practical option, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
