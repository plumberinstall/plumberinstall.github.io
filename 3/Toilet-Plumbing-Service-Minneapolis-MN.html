The epoxy forms a barrier between the within the pipe and the product streaming through it. This repair method is better for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It's important to view what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger clogs and jams - consider composting or placing these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can gather and congeal in your drain too. After finishing cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and utilize for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
