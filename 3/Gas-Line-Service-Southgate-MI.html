<h3>Drain Cleaning Company in Southgate Michigan</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
