Leak legs catch moisture so that it does not get in the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment might make it through a drip leg.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made from aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would usually cause rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being worn out and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater extremely quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
