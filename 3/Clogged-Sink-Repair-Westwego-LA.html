<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible option, particularly when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
